# BikePark Wales

## The UK's Largest Bike Park

If Coed y Brenin wrote the rules for UK trail centres, BikePark Wales rewrote them for gravity riding. Since opening in 2013, this 1,200-acre site in the South Wales valleys has become the undisputed capital of British bike parks — and it's not particularly close.

47 descending trails. 300 metres of vertical drop. Uplift service running all day. Everything from the UK's best beginner downhill trail to pro-level jump lines that have hosted international competitions. BikePark Wales isn't just big — it's properly thought through at every level.

The genius is the ski-resort model. Trails are colour-coded and clearly mapped. You know exactly what you're getting into before you drop in. And unlike natural trails that punish mistakes with consequence, BikePark Wales is designed to help you progress. The berms are forgiving. The jumps have roll-overs. The flow lets you find your limits without exceeding them.

Whether you've never ridden a mountain bike or you're sending 40-foot gaps, there's something here that'll make you grin.

## How It Works

### Uplift Service

The minibuses run continuously from 9am, ferrying you and your bike to the summit. Expect 8-12 runs per day depending on queues and your fitness for loading bikes.

**Booking is essential.** Uplift tickets sell out weeks in advance, especially weekends. Don't turn up hoping — you'll be disappointed.

**Cost:** Around £40-50 for a day pass (prices vary by season)

### Pedal Up Option

If uplift is sold out (or you're a masochist), the 4.6km singletrack climb takes 25-50 minutes depending on fitness. It's challenging but rideable, and means unlimited laps if you've got the legs.

**Day pass:** £15-20 (100% goes to trail maintenance)

### Bike Hire

Full range available from hardtails to full-sus trail bikes to dedicated downhill rigs. Quality is good. **Book ahead** — hire bikes sell out too.

## The Trails

BikePark Wales has 47+ trails. Here are the essential ones:

---

### 🟢 Kermit

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 4.2 km |
| **Vertical** | 300m descent |
| **Time** | 15-20 mins |
| **Surface** | Machine-built |
| **Features** | Berms, flow, gentle gradients |

Kermit isn't just a beginner trail — it's possibly the best introduction to mountain biking anywhere in the world. 4.2 kilometres of flowing green-grade descent that teaches you what a bike can do while never overwhelming you.

**Who it's for:** Complete beginners, nervous riders, anyone who wants to understand what "flow" means, parents riding with kids.

**What to expect:** Wide, bermed corners that guide you through turns. Gentle gradients that build speed without scaring you. A surface so smooth you could ride it on a shopping bike (though please don't). By the bottom, you'll understand why people get addicted to this.

**Why it matters:** Most "beginner" trails are just easy versions of harder things — compromises that aren't quite fun. Kermit was designed from scratch to be genuinely enjoyable at low speeds. It works.

**Local tip:** Book a Ticket to Ride experience if it's your first time. They'll kit you out, teach you the basics, and guide you down. Worth every penny.

### 🔵 Terry's Belly

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 2.8 km |
| **Vertical** | 300m descent |
| **Time** | 12-15 mins |
| **Surface** | Machine-built |
| **Features** | Berms, rollers, optional small jumps |

The natural progression from Kermit. Terry's Belly introduces small features — baby jumps you can roll, steeper sections, tighter berms — while keeping that forgiving flow.

**Who it's for:** Anyone who loved Kermit and wants more, intermediates warming up, riders building confidence.

**What to expect:** The jumps are optional — roll them if you're not feeling it. The berms are tighter but still well-banked. Speed increases naturally but never forces itself on you.

**Local tip:** Don't skip Kermit and jump straight to Terry's. The progression is deliberate — and Kermit is fun enough to warrant a lap anyway.

---

### 🔴 Dai Hard & Enter the Dragon

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 2-3 km each |
| **Vertical** | 300m descent |
| **Time** | 10-15 mins |
| **Surface** | Machine-built |
| **Features** | Proper jumps, berms, drops |

This is where BikePark Wales starts demanding commitment. The reds here feature real jumps (not optional), steeper gradients, and features that require active riding rather than passenger mode.

**Who it's for:** Confident intermediates, riders progressing from blue, anyone comfortable with small jumps and drops.

**What to expect:** Dai Hard is the classic introduction — well-built jumps with good transitions, flowy berms, enough speed to feel fast. Enter the Dragon adds technical variety. Both will show you if you're ready for black.

**Honest warning:** The jumps on red trails aren't rollable. You need to be comfortable leaving the ground. If you're not, spend more time on blue.

---

### 🔴 Vicious Valley

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 2.0 km |
| **Vertical** | 300m descent |
| **Time** | 10-12 mins |
| **Surface** | Natural |
| **Features** | Roots, rocks, natural terrain |

The natural counterpoint to the machine-built reds. Vicious Valley tests your ability to read terrain rather than hit built features. Roots, rocks, off-camber sections, and the kind of trail surface that most UK riding actually involves.

**Who it's for:** Riders who want to build all-round skills, anyone preparing for natural trails elsewhere, variety-seekers.

**What to expect:** Less flow, more thinking. You'll need to pick lines, weight the bike correctly, and stay active. It's humbling if you've only ever ridden groomed trails.

**Local tip:** Ride Vicious Valley when the built trails start feeling same-y. It reminds you that mountain biking isn't just about hitting jumps.

### ⚫ A470 & Rim Dinger

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 2-2.5 km each |
| **Vertical** | 300m descent |
| **Time** | 8-12 mins |
| **Surface** | Machine-built |
| **Features** | Big jumps, gaps, committed features |

The black trails at BikePark Wales are genuinely challenging. A470 is the flagship — big jumps with gaps, step-downs that demand commitment, and speeds that punish hesitation.

**Who it's for:** Experienced riders confident in the air, anyone who's mastered the reds, riders training for racing.

**What to expect:** Features that can't be half-committed. If you case a jump here, you'll know about it. Speed is higher, consequences are real, and the margin for error is slim.

**Honest warning:** Black trails at bike parks are not the same as black trails at trail centres. These are purpose-built to challenge expert riders. Don't assume red-grade fitness translates.

---

### 🟠 50 to 01 & Hot Stepper (Orange/Pro-Line)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 1.5-2 km |
| **Vertical** | 300m descent |
| **Time** | 5-8 mins |
| **Surface** | Machine-built |
| **Features** | Massive jumps, mandatory gaps, pro features |

This is as gnarly as UK bike parks get. The orange-graded trails are competition standard — huge gaps, massive step-downs, and features that make even experienced riders pause.

**Who it's for:** Genuine experts. Riders who compete or train seriously. People who know exactly what they're doing in the air.

**What to expect:** Consequences. These trails will hurt you if you get it wrong. Features are mandatory — there are no chicken lines. Speed is significant.

**Honest warning:** If you're reading this guide to learn about BikePark Wales, these trails probably aren't for you yet. No shame in that — they exist for a tiny minority of riders.

## Facilities

### The Woodland Café

Open all day, serving everything from full Welsh breakfasts to post-ride burgers. Coffee is good. Cake is better. The deck overlooking the trails is prime for watching (and judging) other riders.

### Bike Shop

Well-stocked with parts, protection, clothing. If you've forgotten something or broken something, they can help.

### Workshop

On-site mechanics for the inevitable. They've seen every breakdown and can usually fix it. Expect a wait on busy days.

### Other

- **Free parking** — One less thing to worry about
- **Showers** — Available on site
- **Bike wash** — Pressure washer, the works
- **Changing rooms** — Get out of sweaty kit before the drive home

## Getting There

**Address:** Gethin Woodland Centre, Abercanaid, Merthyr Tydfil, CF48 1YZ

---

## Tips for Your First Visit

1. **Book uplift in advance.** Cannot stress this enough.
2. **Start on Kermit.** Even if you think you're better than that. Feel the trails, understand the style.
3. **Progress gradually.** Green → Blue → Red makes sense. Green → Black doesn't.
4. **Bring knee pads.** Even on easier trails. Gravel rash is real.
5. **Stay hydrated.** The uplift means you're riding constantly — easy to forget to drink.
6. **Watch other riders.** The viewing spots are great for learning lines before you ride them.
