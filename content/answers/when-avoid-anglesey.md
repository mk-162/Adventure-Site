# When should I avoid visiting Anglesey?

## Quick Answer

While Anglesey (Ynys Môn) is a year-round destination, avoid the peak summer weeks (late July and August) if you dislike crowds and higher prices for accommodation. Stormy winter months (November-February) can limit some outdoor activities like kayaking and coastal walks, though they offer dramatic scenery. Bank holiday weekends also see increased visitor numbers and potential traffic congestion, especially on the A55.

## Dodging the Crowds and Peak Prices

Anglesey's popularity swells during the summer holidays, particularly around Beaumaris, Holyhead, and the beaches of Rhosneigr and Trearddur Bay. Expect packed car parks (£5-£10 per day), queues at popular eateries like The Lobster Pot in Church Bay, and limited availability at campsites and B&Bs. Prices for accommodation can increase by 30-50% during this period. If you're after a quieter experience, consider visiting in the shoulder seasons (May-June or September-October) when the weather is often still pleasant, and the island is less congested. Remember to book accommodation and activities well in advance, especially if travelling with a larger group.

## Weather Considerations and Activity Limitations

Anglesey, being an island, is exposed to the elements. Winter months can bring strong winds and heavy rain, making some coastal paths treacherous and water sports like coasteering with operators such as B-Active Rhoscolyn unsafe. While the island rarely sees significant snowfall, icy conditions can affect driving on rural roads. Check weather forecasts before you travel and be prepared to adjust your plans accordingly. Some attractions, like boat trips to Puffin Island, may also have reduced operating hours or be suspended altogether during the off-season. However, winter can be a fantastic time for storm watching from locations like South Stack Lighthouse, offering a different perspective on the island's rugged beauty.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Summer Holidays | Beach lovers, families | Easy to Moderate | Rhosneigr, Trearddur Bay |
| Bank Holiday Weekends | Short breaks, festivals | Easy to Moderate | Various locations |
| Winter Months | Storm watching, solitude | Moderate to Challenging | South Stack, Coastal Paths |

## Practical Tips

- Check the tide times before planning coastal walks, as some sections of the Anglesey Coastal Path are impassable at high tide.
- Book your ferry to Ireland from Holyhead well in advance, especially during peak season, to secure your preferred sailing time and avoid disappointment.
- Consider using the local bus service (TrawsCymru T5) to explore the island and avoid parking hassles in popular areas.
- Pack for all types of weather, even in summer, as conditions can change rapidly. Bring waterproofs, sturdy footwear, and sunscreen.
