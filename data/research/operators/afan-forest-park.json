    "short": "One of Britain's most iconic mountain biking destinations, featuring over 100km of all-weather singletrack trails set in the stunning Afan Valley, South Wales.",
    "full": "Afan Forest Park is one of the world's most established mountain biking destinations, boasting more all-weather singletrack than any other mountain biking centre in Wales. Located in the heart of the Afan Valley, this former coal mining valley has been transformed into a trail riding paradise, offering six superb flowing trails ranging from 7km to over 40km, plus an extreme-graded bike park at Gyfylchi.\n\nThe trails cater to all abilities, from the green-graded Rookie trail and skills park perfect for beginners, through the blue-graded Blue Scar for developing riders, to the renowned red-graded Penhydd, Y Wal (The Wall), White's Level and Blade trails. For those seeking the ultimate challenge, the black-graded W2 trail linking Y Wal and White's Level features some of the most demanding descents and technical singletrack sections in the UK. The gentle Rheilfordd Trail follows the valley floor along an old railway line, perfect for families.\n\nThe Afan Forest Park Visitor Centre serves as the main hub, offering bike hire, repairs, showers, bike wash, and the Base Wales café. The South Wales Miners' Museum within the visitor centre tells the story of the valley's industrial heritage. With stunning scenery, world-class trails maintained by dedicated volunteers, and excellent facilities, Afan Forest Park delivers an unforgettable mountain biking experience where traces of industrial history have been gently reclaimed by nature."
