# Where are the best Mountain Biking locations in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Wales is a mountain biking paradise, offering everything from challenging downhill runs to scenic cross-country trails. Top spots include BikePark Wales in Merthyr Tydfil, Revolution Bike Park near Llangynog, and the natural trails of Coed y Brenin Forest Park. For a more rugged experience, explore the trails in Eryri (Snowdonia) and the Brecon Beacons.

## BikePark Wales and Other Dedicated Parks

BikePark Wales, located near Merthyr Tydfil, is a premier mountain biking destination with trails for all skill levels. Expect to pay around £45 for a day pass. Revolution Bike Park, near Llangynog in Powys, offers uplift services for downhill riders, with day passes around £42. Antur Stiniog, in Blaenau Ffestiniog, also offers a range of downhill trails accessed via uplift, with prices around £40 per day. These parks are generally open year-round, but check their websites for specific opening times and trail conditions, especially during the winter months.

Coed Llandegla Forest, near Wrexham, is another great option for a variety of trails, including family-friendly routes and more challenging singletrack. A day permit costs around £7.

## Natural Trails in Eryri and Beyond

For a more natural experience, head to Coed y Brenin Forest Park in Snowdonia. It boasts a network of trails catering to different abilities, from beginner-friendly routes to technical challenges. Parking costs around £6 for the day. Eryri (Snowdonia) itself offers numerous natural trails, but these are often unmarked and require good navigation skills and experience. The Brecon Beacons National Park also has some fantastic natural trails, particularly around Talybont-on-Usk. Be aware that weather conditions in these upland areas can change rapidly, so be prepared for all eventualities.

## Practical Tips

- Check trail conditions online before you go, especially after heavy rain. Many trail centres have dedicated social media pages or websites with up-to-date information.
- Consider hiring a local guide for Eryri or the Brecon Beacons. They can show you the best trails and ensure your safety in these more remote areas. Companies like MTB Guiding Wales offer guided rides.
- Book uplift services and day passes in advance, particularly during peak season (weekends and school holidays).
- Be aware that parking at popular trail centres can fill up quickly, especially on weekends. Arrive early to secure a spot.
- Always carry essential repair tools, a first-aid kit, and plenty of water. Mountain biking can be demanding, and help may not always be immediately available.
