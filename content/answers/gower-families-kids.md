# Is Gower Peninsula good for families with children?

## Quick Answer

Absolutely! The Gower Peninsula is fantastic for families, offering everything from sandy beaches perfect for paddling to gentle coastal walks with stunning views. Older kids can try surfing lessons at Llangennith, while younger ones will love building sandcastles at Caswell Bay.

## Beaches and Coastal Walks for Little Legs

Gower's beaches are a major draw for families. Caswell Bay is ideal for toddlers, with a gently sloping beach and good facilities, including a cafe and toilets. In summer, expect to pay around £5 for parking. For a longer day out, consider Rhossili Bay, consistently ranked among the UK's best beaches. The walk down to the beach from the clifftop is manageable for most children, and the views are incredible. At low tide, you can even walk out to Worm's Head, but be sure to check tide times carefully to avoid getting stranded! For a quieter experience, Pwll Du Bay offers a secluded cove accessible via a short, wooded walk – perfect for a picnic.

For easy family-friendly walks, try the section of the Wales Coast Path between Mumbles and Langland Bay. It's mostly flat, paved, and offers beautiful sea views. You can reward the kids with an ice cream at Langland Brasserie afterwards. Alternatively, the National Trust's Dinefwr Park, though slightly inland from Gower itself, provides extensive grounds for roaming, a captivating castle to explore (entry around £8 per adult, £4 per child), and even a herd of rare White Park cattle.

## Activities for All Ages

Beyond the beaches, several activity providers cater specifically to families. Gower Activity Centres, based near Horton, offers coasteering sessions suitable for children aged 8 and up (from £45 per person). This involves scrambling along the rocky coastline, swimming in the sea, and tackling small jumps – an exhilarating experience! For something a little more relaxed, consider a guided kayaking tour with Gower Coast Adventures from Oxwich Bay (prices from £35 per person). They offer family-friendly tours exploring the bay's caves and coves.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Sandcastle Building | Toddlers | Easy | Caswell Bay |
| Coastal Walk | All Ages | Easy to Moderate | Mumbles to Langland |
| Coasteering | Older Kids (8+) | Moderate to Challenging | Horton |
| Kayaking Tour | Families | Moderate | Oxwich Bay |

## Practical Tips

- Check the tide times before heading to any beach, especially Rhossili and Worm's Head.
- Pack plenty of layers, even in summer, as the weather can change quickly on the coast.
- Book activities in advance, especially during peak season (July and August).
- Parking at popular beaches like Caswell and Rhossili can fill up quickly, so arrive early or consider using public transport.
