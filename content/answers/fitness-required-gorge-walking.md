# How fit do I need to be for Gorge Walking in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Gorge walking in Wales requires a reasonable level of fitness. You should be comfortable walking on uneven terrain, scrambling over rocks, and wading through water. While not a marathon, expect a few hours of moderate exertion, and be prepared for some short, steep climbs and the occasional jump into a plunge pool.

## Understanding the Physical Demands

Gorge walking, also known as canyoning or gorge scrambling, involves navigating natural watercourses, often in steep-sided valleys. Activities can include walking, climbing, scrambling, swimming, and even waterfall climbing. The level of fitness required varies depending on the specific gorge and the chosen route. For example, a beginner-friendly gorge walk with TYF Adventure in Pembrokeshire might involve more wading and gentle scrambling, while a more challenging route in Eryri (Snowdonia) with a company like Adventure Wales could involve steeper climbs and more demanding obstacles. Expect to use your upper body strength for pulling yourself up and over rocks.

Generally, if you can comfortably hike for a couple of hours on varied terrain, you'll likely be fit enough for most introductory gorge walking experiences. However, it's essential to honestly assess your abilities and choose a suitable level. Consider factors like your balance, agility, and comfort level in water. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions, it's crucial to consult with your doctor before participating. Prices for gorge walking experiences generally range from £50-£90 per person, depending on the location, duration, and operator.

## Gauging Difficulty Levels

Different gorges and operators offer varying levels of difficulty to cater to a range of fitness levels and experience. Here's a general guide:

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Afon Ddu Gorge, Eryri | Beginners & Families | Easy to Moderate | Eryri (Snowdonia) |
| Sgwd y Pannwr, Brecon Beacons | Intermediate adventurers | Moderate | Brecon Beacons National Park |
| Waterfall Jumping at Pontneddfechan | Thrill Seekers | Challenging | Brecon Beacons |

## Practical Tips

- Wear appropriate footwear! Old trainers or walking boots with good grip are essential; avoid sandals or flip-flops. Many operators like Celtic Quest Coasteering in Pembrokeshire offer shoe hire if needed.
- Be prepared for cold water, even in summer. A wetsuit is usually provided by the operator, but consider bringing a rash vest or thermal layer for extra warmth, especially on colder days.
- Book in advance, especially during peak season (July-August) and weekends. Popular gorges can get crowded, and booking ensures you secure a spot.
- Inform the operator of any medical conditions or concerns you may have. They can tailor the experience to your abilities and ensure your safety.
