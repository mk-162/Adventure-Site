# What Are the Best Beaches in Pembrokeshire?

## Quick Answer

Pembrokeshire has over 50 beaches — more quality coastline per mile than almost anywhere in Britain. For families, **Barafundle Bay** and **Tenby South** are hard to beat. For surfing, **Freshwater West** (experienced) or **Whitesands** (beginners). For adventure activities, the **Blue Lagoon at Abereiddy** is iconic. Here are the best, honestly assessed.

## The Detail

### Best for Families

*   **Barafundle Bay:** Consistently rated one of the UK's finest beaches, and it earns it. Golden sand, clear turquoise water, and a short walk from the car park that keeps the crowds manageable. No facilities — bring everything you need. The water looks Mediterranean until you get in (it's not).
*   **Tenby South Beach:** The classic Pembrokeshire family beach. Long sandy stretch, calm waters, close to Tenby town for ice cream and fish and chips. Gets busy in summer — arrive early for a good spot. Caldey Island boat trips leave from the harbour nearby.
*   **Broad Haven South:** Not to be confused with Broad Haven village. Sandy beach, rock pools at low tide, and the iconic Church Rock stack. Family-friendly with space to spread out.
*   **Saundersfoot:** Sandy beach with a harbour village atmosphere. Good for young children — sheltered and shallow. Restaurants and cafés on the doorstep.
*   **Lydstep Haven:** Tucked away and less well-known. Beautiful sand, rock formations, and a smuggler's cave. Gets cut off at high tide — check times.

### Best for Surfing

*   **Freshwater West:** The most powerful and consistent beach break in Pembrokeshire. Big, hollow waves when it's on. Strong currents and shore break make it unsuitable for beginners — this is where experienced surfers come. The beach from Harry Potter (the Shell Cottage scenes).

*   **Whitesands Bay (Traeth Mawr):** The best all-round surf beach for mixed abilities. Surf school on-site, golden sand, and views of Ramsey Island. Works at all stages of the tide. More sheltered than Freshwater West.
*   **Newgale:** Two miles of beach break. Consistent waves, good for beginners and intermediates. The pebble bank at the top can be dramatic in storms. Parking right on the beach road.
*   **Manorbier:** A fun reef/beach break with Manorbier Castle as a backdrop. Works best around high tide. Less consistent than Freshwater West but a more interesting wave.

### Best for Adventure Activities

*   **Blue Lagoon, Abereiddy:** A flooded slate quarry connected to the sea. Famous for [coasteering](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/coasteering) — dramatic cliff jumps, sea caves, and crystal-clear (freezing) water. Also home to the Red Bull Cliff Diving competition. Not a swimming beach — it's deep and cold — but utterly unique.
*   **Porthclais Harbour:** A tiny harbour perfect for launching [sea kayaks](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/kayaking). Paddle out to explore the dramatic coast around St Davids, with sea caves and seal colonies.
*   **St Non's Bay:** Rocky coastline south of St Davids. Excellent for [wild swimming](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/wild-swimming) and coasteering. Dramatic and atmospheric, especially in rougher conditions.

### Best for Wildlife

*   **Marloes Sands:** Vast, dramatic beach with fascinating geology (the rock strata are extraordinary). Great for seal spotting, especially in autumn. The walk down is steep but worth it. One of the quieter major beaches.
*   **Martin's Haven:** Not a beach for sunbathing, but the departure point for Skomer Island (puffins!) and a good spot for watching grey seals. The seal pupping season (September-November) is extraordinary.
*   **Stackpole Quay:** Tiny harbour with a beautiful cove. Gateway to the Stackpole Estate and the lily ponds. Boat trips and otter spotting if you're lucky.

### Best for Solitude

*   **Abermawr:** A remote, pebbly beach backed by woodland. No facilities, limited parking, and usually empty. Beautiful in a wild, atmospheric way.
*   **Pwll Gwaelod:** At the bottom of the Dinas Island headland walk. A tiny cove that few people venture to. Stunning.
*   **Traeth Llyfn:** Between Abereiddy and Porthgain. A small sandy beach with dramatic rock walls. Accessed via the coast path — the walk keeps it quiet.

## Best Time to Visit

Summer (June-August) for swimming and beach days. September for quieter beaches and good surf. Spring for coastal walks with wildflowers and empty sand. Winter for dramatic storm watching — Freshwater West and Newgale in a winter gale are awe-inspiring (from a safe distance).

## The Smart Choice

Barafundle Bay for a postcard-perfect beach day. Whitesands for surfing with the family. Blue Lagoon for an adventure you'll never forget. And if you want quiet? Go to any Pembrokeshire beach on a Tuesday in October — they're all yours.
