  heroContent: `South Wales is adventure territory with a story to tell. The valleys that once powered the Industrial Revolution have reinvented themselves: former collieries now host mountain bike parks, railway lines have become walking trails, and the dramatic landscapes carved by industry rival any natural wonder. This is Bike Park Wales country—the UK's first full-scale MTB centre—and the gateway to the Brecon Beacons' southern slopes.

The valleys radiate north from Cardiff like fingers reaching for the hills. Merthyr Tydfil, Pontypridd, the Rhondda—these are names from coal's heyday, now reinvented as adventure bases. The new South Wales Metro is transforming transport, while the canal towpaths and former railway lines offer traffic-free cycling and walking. Above it all, the Beacons beckon.

This isn't pretty-postcard Wales. It's gritty, real, and full of warmth. The heritage is everywhere—the winding gear, the terraced houses climbing hillsides, the male voice choirs that still rehearse in workingmen's clubs. But the new story is adventure: world-class mountain biking, waterfall walks, and some of the easiest access to wilderness anywhere in Britain.`,
