# What to Pack for Hiking in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Packing for a hike in Wales requires preparation for unpredictable weather. Essential items include waterproof outerwear, sturdy hiking boots with good ankle support, and layers of clothing for temperature adjustments. Don't forget a map, compass (or GPS device), a fully charged phone, a first-aid kit, and sufficient water and snacks to sustain you on your chosen trail.

## The Detail

The specific items you'll need will vary depending on the length and difficulty of your hike, as well as the time of year. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Clothing:**
    *   **Base layers:** Moisture-wicking fabrics like merino wool or synthetic materials are ideal to keep you dry and comfortable. Avoid cotton, which retains moisture and can make you cold.
    *   **Mid-layers:** Fleece or insulated jackets provide warmth. Consider a lightweight down jacket for colder months.
    *   **Outer layer:** A waterproof and windproof jacket and trousers are crucial. Look for features like a hood, adjustable cuffs, and taped seams for maximum protection. Breathability is also important to prevent overheating.
    *   **Hiking trousers or shorts:** Choose quick-drying and durable materials.
    *   **Hiking socks:** Wool or synthetic hiking socks designed to prevent blisters are a must.
    *   **Hat and gloves:** Even in summer, the weather can change quickly, especially at higher altitudes.
*   **Footwear:**
    *   **Hiking boots:** Invest in a good pair of hiking boots that provide ankle support and a sturdy grip. Make sure they are properly broken in before your hike. Consider waterproof boots for wet conditions.
    *   **Spare socks:** Always a good idea in case your feet get wet.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   **Map and compass:** Essential for navigating, especially in areas with poor phone signal. Learn how to use them properly. Ordnance Survey maps are recommended for Wales.
    *   **GPS device or phone with GPS:** A GPS device can be a useful backup, but don't rely solely on it as batteries can run out. Download offline maps to your phone.
*   **Other essentials:**
    *   **First-aid kit:** Include blister plasters, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and any personal medications.
    *   **Water:** Bring at least 2 liters of water, or more for longer hikes. Consider using a hydration reservoir or water bottles.
    *   **Snacks:** High-energy snacks like trail mix, energy bars, dried fruit, and nuts are important for maintaining energy levels.
    *   **Sunscreen and sunglasses:** Even on cloudy days, the sun can be strong, especially at higher altitudes.
    *   **Headlamp or flashlight:** Essential if you are hiking in the dark or if you get delayed.
    *   **Whistle:** For signaling in emergencies.
    *   **Rucksack:** Choose a comfortable and durable rucksack with enough capacity to carry all your gear. Consider a rain cover for your rucksack.
    *   **Walking poles:** Can provide extra stability and reduce strain on your knees, especially on steep descents.
    *   **Rubbish bag:** Pack it in, pack it out. Leave no trace.

## The Smart Choice

For most hiking in Wales, even during summer, prioritize waterproof and windproof layers. A lightweight, packable waterproof jacket and trousers can be easily stowed away when not needed. I'd recommend investing in quality hiking boots with good ankle support and traction, especially if you plan on tackling more challenging routes like the Snowdon Summit Hike or Crib Goch Guided Walk. Knowing how to use a map and compass is crucial; don't rely solely on your phone.
