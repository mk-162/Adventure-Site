# How Fit Do I Need to Be for Caving in Wales?

## Quick Answer

It depends entirely on the cave and the trip. A family-friendly showcave walk needs nothing more than basic mobility. A proper beginner caving trip requires reasonable fitness — you'll be crawling, climbing, and squeezing for 2-3 hours. Advanced potholing demands serious stamina, upper body strength, and mental resilience. Be honest with yourself and with the operator.

## Assessing Your Caving Fitness

The fitness requirements for caving vary dramatically depending on what you're doing:

### Easy / Family-Friendly
*   **Dan yr Ogof Showcaves (Brecon Beacons):** Walking through lit cave passages on paved paths. Suitable for anyone who can manage a gentle walk, including children and older adults.
*   **Porth yr Ogof entrance (Ystradfellte):** Walk into the largest cave entrance in Wales and see the river disappear underground. Flat ground, minimal effort.
*   **Fitness needed:** Can you walk for 30-60 minutes? You're fine.

### Beginner / Moderate Guided Trips
*   **Guided trips with operators like Black Mountain Activities (Brecon Beacons):** These involve real caving — crawling on hands and knees, climbing over boulders, wading through shallow water, and navigating uneven terrain in the dark for 2-3 hours.
*   **Fitness needed:** You should be comfortable with sustained physical activity. Can you walk briskly for an hour, climb a flight of stairs without being winded, and get down on your hands and knees and back up again? You'll manage.
*   **What catches people out:** It's not the cardiovascular fitness so much as the joint strain. Crawling on rock is hard on knees and wrists. If you have significant knee, back, or shoulder problems, discuss this with the operator before booking.

### Moderate / Adventure Trips
*   **Go Below Underground Adventures (Conwy):** Their challenge trips involve climbing, zip lining underground, traversing via ferrata, and potentially abseiling. Physically demanding and sustained over 3-4 hours.
*   **Fitness needed:** Regular exercise. You should be able to sustain moderate physical effort for several hours. Upper body strength matters — you'll be pulling yourself up and over obstacles.

### Advanced / Potholing
*   **OFD (Ogof Ffynnon Ddu) through-trips, deep cave systems:** These are multi-hour expeditions (4-8+ hours) involving vertical rope work, crawling through constrictions, and navigating cold water in challenging conditions.
*   **Fitness needed:** High. You need sustained endurance, good upper body strength, flexibility to fit through tight spaces, and the mental resilience to stay calm underground for extended periods. Previous caving experience is essential.

## Practical Tips

*   **Be honest with the operator.** Good operators will ask about your fitness level and match you to an appropriate trip. Exaggerating your abilities puts yourself and others at risk.
*   **Mention any injuries or conditions.** Bad knees, back problems, asthma, claustrophobia — all worth mentioning. Operators can often accommodate these with the right trip choice.
*   **Core strength helps more than cardio.** Caving is about manoeuvring your body through awkward spaces, not running marathons. Planks, squats, and press-ups are better training than treadmills.
*   **Eat well before you go.** Caving burns serious energy, especially in cold, wet conditions. Don't go on an empty stomach.
*   **Start easy.** If you're unsure, book a beginner trip first. You can always do something harder next time. The reverse is much less fun.

The cave temperature in the Brecon Beacons sits at about 10°C year-round. Combined with water and wet conditions, this means your body works harder to stay warm. Thermal base layers under your oversuit make a genuine difference to how comfortable (and therefore how fit) you feel.
