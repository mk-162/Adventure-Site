# What are the hidden gems and secret spots in Pembrokeshire?

## Quick Answer

Pembrokeshire's coastline is dotted with secluded coves and dramatic rock formations away from the crowds. Seek out Church Doors Cove near Skrinkle Haven for a stunning natural arch, or explore the lesser-known sections of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path between Solva and St Davids for breathtaking views and total solitude. For inland adventures, try searching for the blue lagoon, or for history buffs, explore the Castell Henllys Iron Age Fort.

## Secret Beaches and Coastal Walks

Beyond the popular beaches like Barafundle Bay, Pembrokeshire hides some truly special coastal secrets. Church Doors Cove, accessible via steep steps from Skrinkle Haven (near Manorbier), reveals a magnificent natural arch at low tide. Be mindful of the tides, as access can be cut off. For a longer walk, tackle the section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path between Solva and St Davids. This stretch offers dramatic cliffs, hidden coves, and the chance to spot seals and seabirds. The walk can be challenging in places, with some steep ascents and descents.

Another gem is Traeth Llyfn, a sandy beach north of Abereiddi, accessible via a steep metal staircase. Its remote location keeps it relatively quiet, even in peak season. Consider kayaking with TYF Adventure from St Davids to explore the coastline from a different perspective; a half-day tour costs around £65 per person.

## Inland Discoveries and Historical Sites

Venture inland to discover Pembrokeshire's hidden historical and natural wonders. The Blue Lagoon near Abereiddi, a former slate quarry flooded by the sea, is now a stunning turquoise pool perfect for a wild swim – though be warned, it's popular with coasteering groups! For a dose of history, visit Castell Henllys Iron Age Fort, near Eglwyswrw, a reconstructed Iron Age village offering a glimpse into Pembrokeshire's past. Entry is around £7 for adults.

| Traeth Llyfn | Seclusion, quiet beach walks | Moderate (steep access) | North of Abereiddi |
| Castell Henllys | History buffs, families | Easy | Near Eglwyswrw |

## Practical Tips
