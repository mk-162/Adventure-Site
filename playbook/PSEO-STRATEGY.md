### Cross-Linking Rules

1. **Every spot page links to:**
   - Its region hub
   - Its activity hub
   - Related spots (same activity, same region)
   - Relevant operators
   - "Best of" list it appears in

2. **Every "best of" page links to:**
   - All spot profiles in the list
   - Region page (if regional)
   - Activity hub
   - Related "best of" lists

3. **Every region page links to:**
   - All activities available in that region
   - Best of lists for that region
   - Key spot profiles
   - Operators in region

## 9. Unique Value Requirements

### Thin Content = Death

**BAD (will be penalised):**
```
# Best Beaches in Gower

Gower has great beaches. Here are the best beaches in Gower.

1. Rhossili Bay - A beautiful beach in Gower.
2. Three Cliffs Bay - Another beautiful beach in Gower.
```

**GOOD (will rank):**
```
# Best Beaches in Gower: The Definitive Guide

Gower was Britain's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, 
and it earned that title largely on the strength of its beaches. 
Within a few miles you've got surfing beaches, family bays, 
hidden coves, and jaw-dropping cliff-backed stretches...

## 1. Rhossili Bay — Best Overall

Three miles of golden sand backed by the dramatic sweep of 
Rhossili Down. This isn't just Gower's best beach — it 
regularly tops "best beaches in Britain" lists and deserves 
every accolade.

**Why it wins:** The scale is breathtaking. At low tide you 
can walk the full length and still feel like you've barely 
scratched the surface...

**Best for:** Surfers (north end), walkers (everywhere), 
photographers (sunset)

**Watch out for:** The tide comes in fast. Worm's Head 
access is tidal — check times or get stranded.

| Quick Facts | |
|-------------|---|
| Length | 4.8km |
| Parking | £6, fills early summer |
| Lifeguards | Seasonal at north end |
| Dogs | Restricted May-Sep |
```

### Per-Page Uniqueness Checklist

- [ ] Unique 150+ word intro (not template)
- [ ] Specific "why this ranks here" for each item
- [ ] Local tips not found elsewhere
- [ ] Honest negatives ("watch out for...")
- [ ] Data cards with specific stats
- [ ] Original photography or properly licensed
- [ ] Links to deeper content (profiles, operators)

---

## 10. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create page templates for each type
- [ ] Build data → page generation pipeline
- [ ] Generate 10 "best of" national pages
- [ ] Generate 20 highest-value location pages

### Phase 2: Depth (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Generate all spot profile pages (120)
- [ ] Generate regional "best of" pages (30)
- [ ] Add schema markup
- [ ] Internal linking pass

### Phase 3: Expansion (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Persona pages
- [ ] Directory pages
- [ ] Long-tail "best of" pages
- [ ] Second internal linking pass

### Phase 4: Refinement (Ongoing)
- [ ] Monitor indexation
- [ ] Track rankings
- [ ] Update based on performance
- [ ] Add new spots to databases
- [ ] Refresh "best of" rankings annually

---

## 11. Success Metrics

### Track per page type:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Indexation rate | >95% within 30 days |
| Avg position (target keywords) | Top 20 within 90 days |
| Organic traffic | 10% MoM growth |
| Time on page | >2 minutes |
| Bounce rate | <60% |
| Click to operator | >5% |

### Warning Signs:

- Pages not indexing → content too thin
- Rankings dropping → quality issue or cannibalisation
- High bounce → not matching intent
- Manual action → penalty (catastrophic)

---

## 12. Content Production Workflow

### For each "Best Of" page:

1. **Query database** for spots matching criteria
2. **Rank spots** using defined criteria + editorial judgment
3. **Write unique intro** (150+ words, not template)
4. **Write spot entries** (100+ words each, specific to why it ranks)
5. **Add data cards** from database
6. **Add photos** (1+ per spot)
7. **Add internal links** (profiles, operators, related)
8. **Add schema markup** (ItemList, Place)
9. **Quality check** against checklist
10. **Publish** and add to sitemap

### Estimated time per page:
- "Best of" list: 2-3 hours
- Location page: 1-2 hours  
- Spot profile: 30-60 minutes (data-driven)

---

## Summary

**We have:** 170+ spots with rich data (high defensibility)

**We're building:**
- 70 location pages (activity × region)
- 55 curation pages (best of lists)
- 120 profile pages (individual spots)
- 20 directory pages (operators)
- 8 persona pages

**= ~273 pages of genuine value**

Each page:
- Answers a real search query
- Provides unique value (not template swaps)
- Links to related content
- Drives users toward operators

**This is the playbook.** Execute it systematically and Adventure Wales becomes the definitive resource for Welsh adventure.
