  "introduction": "Snowdonia gets a lot of rain — typically 3,000mm per year in the mountains. The upside of all that water is waterfalls. The national park is studded with cascades, from easy-access tourist favourites to hidden plunge pools that require a proper walk to reach.\n\nUnlike the concentrated Waterfall Country of the Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia's waterfalls are spread across the park. Some are on the main Snowdon hiking routes, others hidden in quiet valleys that most visitors never explore. The variety is enormous: 37-metre single-drop cascades, multi-step falls in forested gorges, and remote mountain cataracts that you'll have entirely to yourself.\n\nOne universal tip: visit after 2-3 days of rain for maximum flow. Many Snowdonia waterfalls reduce to a trickle in dry summer spells. The wettest months (October-January) are often the most spectacular.",
  "rankingCriteria": "Rankings combine the waterfall's visual impact, accessibility, the quality of the surrounding walk, and how well it rewards a visit in different conditions. We favour waterfalls that deliver genuine drama and are worth a dedicated trip, rather than just a nice feature on a bigger walk.",

      "question": "Can you swim in Snowdonia waterfalls?",
      "answer": "Some have plunge pools deep enough for swimming, but the water is very cold (typically 5-10°C year-round). The Watkin Path pools (#9) and some pools below Ceunant Mawr (#6) are swimmable. Never swim directly below falling water, and be aware of changing water levels."

    {
      "question": "Are Snowdonia waterfalls free to visit?",
      "answer": "Almost all are free to visit. Swallow Falls (#3) charges £2 for the viewing platform (but you can see the falls from the road bridge for free). Parking typically costs £3-7 at NRW or National Trust car parks. Pistyll Rhaeadr asks for a parking donation."
