# What are the best adventure activities in Carmarthenshire?

## Quick Answer

Carmarthenshire offers a fantastic mix of coastal and inland adventures. Explore the stunning coastline with coasteering or kayaking, or head inland for mountain biking and hiking in the Brecon Beacons National Park. For a unique experience, try caving in the Ogofau Gold Mines.

## Coastal Adventures

Carmarthenshire's coastline is perfect for water-based adventures. Head to Llansteffan Beach for kayaking with views of the historic castle, or try coasteering along the rugged coastline near Pendine Sands. Several local operators offer guided tours and equipment hire, including Carmarthen Bay Kayaks, with half-day kayak tours from £45 per person. Be aware that the tides can be strong, so always check tide times and consider going with an experienced guide, especially if you're new to the sport. During the summer months, you might even spot dolphins!

For a different perspective, explore the coastline on horseback with several stables offering beach rides near Cefn Sidan. Expect to pay around £30-£40 for a one-hour ride. Keep in mind that beach access for horses may be restricted during peak season to protect nesting birds and other wildlife.

## Inland Adventures

Inland, Carmarthenshire boasts part of the Brecon Beacons National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog), offering excellent hiking and mountain biking trails. The Black Mountain (Y Mynydd Du) range provides challenging climbs with rewarding panoramic views. The Llyn y Fan Fach and Llyn y Fan Fawr loop is a popular hike, but be prepared for changeable weather conditions, even in summer. Always wear appropriate footwear and carry waterproofs.

For a unique adventure, explore the Roman gold mines at the National Trust's Dolaucothi Gold Mines near Pumsaint. Guided tours take you underground to experience the ancient mining tunnels (adults £12, children £6). Be aware that the tunnels can be tight and claustrophobic, so this activity may not be suitable for everyone.
