# What should I expect on my first Gorge Walking experience?

## Quick Answer

Expect to get wet, have a blast scrambling over rocks, and potentially experience some exhilarating (but safe!) jumps into pools. Gorge walking with a reputable operator like TYF Adventure in Pembrokeshire or Zip World in Eryri (Snowdonia) involves navigating a river gorge, typically with a qualified instructor, using a combination of walking, climbing, and swimming techniques.

## Diving into the Gorge: What It's Really Like

Gorge walking, also known as canyoning or gorge scrambling, is a fantastic way to experience the Welsh landscape up close. You'll be equipped with a wetsuit, buoyancy aid, and helmet, so even the chilly Welsh waters won't be a problem. With TYF Adventure in Pembrokeshire, you might find yourself exploring the stunning St. David's coastline, tackling natural water slides and traversing rocky sections. Expect water depths to vary, from ankle-deep to requiring short swims. In Eryri, Zip World offers gorge walking experiences in the shadow of the mountains, often involving steeper climbs and more challenging obstacles.

The experience isn't just about adrenaline; it's also about teamwork and problem-solving. Your instructor will guide you on the best routes and techniques, ensuring everyone in the group is comfortable and safe. A half-day gorge walking experience typically costs between £45-£75 per person, depending on the operator and location. Keep in mind that some gorges are more suitable for beginners than others; operators will usually tailor the route to the group's ability.

## Choosing the Right Gorge for You

Different gorges offer different experiences, so it's worth considering what you're looking for before booking.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Afon Ddu Gorge (near Snowdon) | Those seeking a challenging scramble with stunning mountain views | Moderate to Challenging | Eryri (Snowdonia) |
| River Neath, Waterfall Country | Waterfall lovers and those wanting a gentler introduction | Easy to Moderate | Brecon Beacons |
| St. David's Coastline Gorges | Coastal scenery and a mix of scrambling and swimming | Moderate | Pembrokeshire |

## Practical Tips

- Book in advance, especially during peak season (summer months), as gorge walking is a popular activity.
- Don't wear your best trainers! Choose old shoes or boots that you don't mind getting wet and potentially scuffed.
- Check the weather forecast beforehand. While gorge walking is still possible in the rain, high water levels can make some routes unsafe. Your operator will likely reschedule if conditions are too dangerous.
- Bring a towel, a complete change of clothes, and a plastic bag for your wet gear. There are usually changing facilities available, but they can be basic.
