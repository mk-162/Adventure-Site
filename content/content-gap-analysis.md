## Part 1: Missing Activity Types (with Search Demand Evidence)

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY — Clear search demand, multiple competitors covering these

#### 1. Horse Riding & Pony Trekking
- **Search evidence**: Visit Wales has a dedicated section (`visitwales.com/things-do/adventure-and-activities/horse-riding`). Brecon Beacons alone has "over 600 miles of bridle paths and tracks" (breconbeacons.org). Multiple operators: Cantref Riding Centre, Grange Trekking, Trans Wales Trails, Tregoyd Mountain Riders, Llangorse Riding Centre.
- **Competitor coverage**: Visit Wales, Brecon Beacons NPA, Go North Wales all have horse riding pages.
- **Why it matters**: Family-friendly, all-ages appeal. Strong in Brecon Beacons, Mid Wales, Snowdonia. Prices from £10 (20-min pony ride) to £59 (full day).
- **Regions**: Brecon Beacons (primary), Mid Wales, Snowdonia, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire.

#### 2. Fishing (Sea Angling, Fly Fishing, Coarse)
- **Search evidence**: Dedicated website `fishingwales.net` with 1,000+ locations. Visit Wales has full section (`visitwales.com/things-do/adventure-and-activities/fishing`). Famous rivers include the Teifi (sewin/sea trout), Dee (grayling), Wye (salmon), Usk (trout). Sea fishing off Pembrokeshire and Llŷn Peninsula.
- **Competitor coverage**: Visit Wales, Fishing in Wales (official), TripAdvisor all rank highly.
- **Why it matters**: Year-round activity, strong in regions we currently underserve (Wye Valley, Mid Wales, Ceredigion). Attracts a demographic (35-65 males) that overlaps poorly with our current adventure-focused audience — broadens reach.
- **Regions**: Wye Valley (primary), Mid Wales, Pembrokeshire (sea), Carmarthenshire, Snowdonia.

#### 3. Wildlife & Birdwatching
- **Search evidence**: Skomer Island puffins alone draws huge search interest — "nearly 43,000 Atlantic puffins" (largest colony in southern UK). RSPB South Stack on Anglesey, red kites in Mid Wales, dolphins in Cardigan Bay. Visit Wales has dedicated wildlife section.
- **Competitor coverage**: Welsh Wildlife Trust, Visit Wales, RSPB, National Trust all have extensive content. Skomer day trips are a major tourism product.
- **Why it matters**: Growing eco-tourism market. Strong seasonal content angle (puffins April-July, red kites year-round, dolphins summer). Spans multiple regions. Family-friendly and accessible.
- **Regions**: Pembrokeshire (primary — Skomer/Skokholm), Anglesey (South Stack), Mid Wales (red kites), Carmarthenshire (Cardigan Bay dolphins).

#### 4. Paintballing & Laser Tag
- **Search evidence**: Adventures Wales (adventureswales.co.uk) prominently features paintball. Multiple operators near Cardiff: Taskforce Paintball (Cowbridge), Bedlam Paintball, Adventures Wales (Porthcawl). Teamforce near Swansea. VisitBritain lists it for Pembrokeshire (Heatherton).
- **Competitor coverage**: Visit Wales mentions paintball in South Wales activities. Strong stag/hen and birthday party market.
- **Why it matters**: Major driver for group bookings (stag/hen, corporate, birthdays). Relatively accessible year-round. Laser tag opens up younger age groups (8+).
- **Regions**: South Wales (primary — Cardiff area), Pembrokeshire (Heatherton), North Wales.

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY — Good demand, complements existing content

#### 5. Quad Biking & Off-Road Driving
- **Search evidence**: Visit Wales has a dedicated quad biking page. Taff Valley Quad Bike & Activity Centre (near Cardiff, 30+ years operating). Adventure North Wales offers quad biking packages. Also popular for stag/hen parties.
- **Why it matters**: Popular group activity, strong stag/hen crossover. Good weather-resilient option.
- **Regions**: South Wales (Taff Valley), North Wales, Brecon Beacons.

#### 6. Beaches & Coastal Activities
- **Search evidence**: "Best beaches Wales" is an enormous search term. Wales Online's beach guide, TripAdvisor beach categories, Visit Wales beaches section — all highly trafficked. Rhossili Bay (Gower), Three Cliffs Bay, Barafundle Bay (Pembrokeshire), Cefn Sidan (longest beach in Wales). 
- **Why it matters**: Currently we cover surfing and coasteering at beaches, but have no "beaches" category. Visitors search for beaches as a destination, not just an activity. A beaches category could aggregate and cross-link.
- **Regions**: Gower (primary), Pembrokeshire, Anglesey, Llŷn Peninsula, North Wales Coast.

### 🟢 LOWER PRIORITY — Niche but valuable

#### 7. Archery & Clay Pigeon Shooting
- **Search evidence**: Often bundled with quad biking, paintball. Taff Valley offers both. Adventures Wales lists archery. Popular as add-on activities for group days.
- **Regions**: South Wales, Brecon Beacons.

#### 8. White Water Rafting
- **Search evidence**: CIWW (Cardiff International White Water) is a major facility. Also natural rivers in Snowdonia. Currently partially covered under kayaking but deserves its own category.
- **Regions**: South Wales (CIWW Cardiff Bay), Snowdonia.

## Part 2: Underserved Regions

| Region | Current Strength | Gap |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| **Wye Valley** | Minimal | Fishing (River Wye is world-famous for salmon), walking, canoeing, heritage/castles |

| **Carmarthenshire** | Light | Fishing, horse riding, beaches (Cefn Sidan), Cardigan Bay dolphins |

| **South Wales** | Activity-focused | Stag/hen packages, paintball, quad biking, white water (CIWW) |

## Part 3: Missing Topics & Content Types

### Audience-Based Content (Missing Entirely)
1. **Stag & Hen Party Guides** — Massive search demand. "Wales stag do" and "Cardiff stag weekend" return dozens of dedicated operators (Adventures Wales, Adventure Britain, Big Blue Adventures, StagWeb, Blue Ocean Activities). Currently zero content addressing this audience.
2. **Family Activity Guides** — "Wales family activities" is high-volume. Visit Wales, Go North Wales, and National Trust all have family-specific sections. We need "best activities for families" content per region.
3. **Corporate Team Building** — Multiple operators offer this (Adventures Wales, Blue Ocean Activities, Shaggy Sheep Wales). No dedicated content.

### Seasonal Content (Thin)
4. **Monthly "What's On" Guides** — What to do in Wales in January, February, etc. Seasonal wildlife (puffins April-July), seasonal activities (surfing best Sep-Oct), weather expectations.
5. **Bank Holiday & School Holiday Guides** — Peak search times, peak booking times.

### Practical Content (Missing)
6. **Budget Guides** — "Cheap things to do in Wales", free activities, best value days out.
7. **Rainy Day Activities** — Wales gets rain. "Indoor activities Wales" is a major search. Underground trampolines and toboggan are a start but we need more: climbing walls, escape rooms, indoor surf.
8. **Accessibility Guides** — Wheelchair-accessible trails, adaptive activities, operators with accessibility provisions.
