## 4. ACTIVITY HUB PAGES (5 manual)

These are the `/[activity]` mega pages with rich editorial content:

| Activity | URL | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Mountain Biking | `/mountain-biking` | ✅ Rich (37KB) |
| Coasteering | `/coasteering` | ✅ Rich (39KB) |
| Hiking | `/hiking` | ✅ Rich (39KB) |
| Surfing | `/surfing` | ✅ Rich (40KB) |
| Caving | `/caving` | ✅ Rich (39KB) |

**⚠️ NOT IN SITEMAP** — These hub pages are not being indexed!

## 5. THE DUPLICATE PROBLEM

### URLs targeting "Mountain Biking Wales"

| URL | Type | Content | In Sitemap? |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `/mountain-biking` | Hub page | 8,700 chars, trail tables, videos, FAQs | ❌ NO |
| `/activities/type/mountain-biking` | Listing | 1,400 chars, activity cards | ❌ NO |
| `/snowdonia/things-to-do/mountain-biking` | Combo | 4,200 chars, regional | ✅ YES |
| `/brecon-beacons/things-to-do/mountain-biking` | Combo | Similar | ✅ YES |
| `/south-wales/things-to-do/mountain-biking` | Combo | Similar | ✅ YES |
| `/mid-wales/things-to-do/mountain-biking` | Combo | Similar | ✅ YES |
| `/search?activity=mountain-biking` | Search | Broken/empty | ❌ NO |

**Result:** Your best content (hub) isn't indexed, while 4 combo pages compete with each other.

## 6. WHY WORDS LIKE "activities" AND "type" EXIST IN URLs

### The Problem: Namespace Collisions

When you have:
- Regions like `/snowdonia`
- Activities like `/mountain-biking`

Both use `/[slug]` at the root level. Next.js can't tell them apart without a prefix.

### Current Solution (Messy)

```
/activities/type/[type]     ← "activities" + "type" needed to avoid collision
/activities/[slug]          ← Individual activity needs "activities" prefix
/[region]                   ← Region takes the clean root
/[region]/things-to-do      ← Extra words for clarity
```

### Why This Happened

1. **Regions got priority** — They took `/snowdonia` (clean)
2. **Activities needed a home** — `/activities/coasteering` (prefixed)
3. **Activity types needed listing** — `/activities/type/mountain-biking` (double prefix)
4. **Then hubs were added** — `/mountain-biking` (conflict with regions!)

### The Collision Risk

If you have both:
- `/mountain-biking` (activity hub)
- `/snowdonia` (region)

Next.js uses `[region]` catch-all and might serve wrong page. Current code checks if slug is a valid region first.

## 7. THE IDEAL URL STRUCTURE

### Option A: Activity-First (Recommended)

```
/mountain-biking                    ← Hub (canonical)
/mountain-biking/snowdonia          ← Regional variant
/mountain-biking/book               ← All bookable activities
/mountain-biking/events             ← Related events

/snowdonia                          ← Region hub
/snowdonia/stay                     ← Accommodation
```

**Pros:** Clean hierarchy, activities as primary content  
**Cons:** Requires redirects from current structure

### Option B: Keep Regions Primary

```
/snowdonia                          ← Region hub
/snowdonia/mountain-biking          ← Activity in region (not /things-to-do/)
/snowdonia/stay                     ← Accommodation

/explore/mountain-biking            ← National activity hub (prefixed)
```

**Pros:** Regions stay clean  
**Cons:** Still need prefix for activity hubs

### Option C: Use Subdomains

```
activities.adventurewales.co.uk/mountain-biking
snowdonia.adventurewales.co.uk
```

**Pros:** Complete separation  
**Cons:** Overkill, splits domain authority

## 8. WHAT DOESN'T NEED "activities" OR "type"

### These are fine:
- `/snowdonia` — Region hub ✅
- `/snowdonia/things-to-do` — Region activities list ✅
- `/mountain-biking` — Activity hub ✅ (if we keep hubs separate)

### These could be simplified:
- `/activities/coasteering` → Could be `/book/coasteering`
- `/activities/type/mountain-biking` → Could redirect to `/mountain-biking`

### The "type" in `/activities/type/` is redundant

Originally meant:
- `/activities/[slug]` = individual activity (e.g., "Coasteering Classic at Preseli")
- `/activities/type/[type]` = all activities of a type (e.g., "all coasteering")

But `/mountain-biking` hub does the same thing better. **Delete `/activities/type/`.**

---

## 9. RECOMMENDED FIX

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Today)
1. Add hub pages to sitemap (`/mountain-biking`, etc.)
2. Add canonical to `/activities/type/*` pointing to hub
3. Fix home page search bar routing

### Phase 2: Consolidate (This Week)
1. 301 redirect `/activities/type/*` → `/*`
2. Consider redirecting `/[region]/things-to-do/[type]` → `/[type]/[region]`

### Phase 3: Simplify (Future)
1. Rename `/activities/[slug]` → `/book/[slug]` or embed in hub
2. Remove "things-to-do" from URLs — just `/snowdonia/hiking`
3. Single canonical per intent

---

## 10. CURRENT SITEMAP GAPS

### Missing (Should Be Indexed)
- [ ] `/mountain-biking` (hub)
- [ ] `/coasteering` (hub)
- [ ] `/hiking` (hub)
- [ ] `/surfing` (hub)
- [ ] `/caving` (hub)
- [ ] `/itineraries/[slug]` (individual itineraries)

### Indexed But Shouldn't Be
- [ ] `/activities/type/*` (if redirecting)
- [ ] Duplicate activity URLs (sea-kayaking-tour appears twice)

---

## Summary

**You have 815 indexed pages but your 5 best pieces of content (the hub pages) aren't indexed.**

The `/activities/type/` path is redundant now that hub pages exist. The "type" prefix was a workaround for namespace issues that's no longer needed.

Recommended action: Redirect `/activities/type/*` to the hubs, add hubs to sitemap, and simplify URLs over time.
