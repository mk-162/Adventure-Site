  "introduction": "The Brecon Beacons — officially Bannau Brycheiniog since 2023 — offer a completely different walking experience to Snowdonia. The mountains are smoother, the paths are grassy rather than rocky, and the landscape feels ancient and rolling rather than jagged. The trade-off is atmosphere in abundance: dark reservoirs, mythical lakes, and waterfalls hidden in gorges that feel genuinely enchanted.\n\nPen y Fan dominates the headlines (and the car park), but the best walks in the Beacons are often the ones that take you away from the central peaks. Waterfall Country in the south rivals anything in the UK for beauty, the Black Mountains on the eastern edge offer solitude that Snowdonia can't match, and Sugar Loaf is a perfect introductory peak.\n\nThis list deliberately ranges from easy waterfall walks to full mountain circuits. The Beacons reward exploration beyond the obvious.",
  "rankingCriteria": "We've walked all of these routes in multiple seasons and conditions. Rankings factor in scenery, variety, crowd levels, path quality, and that hard-to-define feeling of 'was that worth getting up for?' We favour routes that deliver something you can't get on any other UK walk.",

    {
      "question": "What's the easiest walk in the Brecon Beacons?",
      "answer": "Henrhyd Falls (#7) is the shortest and easiest — a 15-minute walk to the tallest waterfall in South Wales. Sgwd Gwladus (#5) is also easy. For something slightly longer, Talybont Reservoir (#9) is flat and well-surfaced, suitable for pushchairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How hard is the walk up Pen y Fan?",
      "answer": "Via the Storey Arms route (#2), Pen y Fan is manageable for most reasonably fit people — 3-4 hours, 8km, with 500m of climbing on a well-maintained stone path. It's steeper than it looks and exposed on the summit in wind, but no scrambling is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the Brecon Beacons waterfalls worth visiting?",
      "answer": "Absolutely — Waterfall Country is one of the best waterfall areas in the UK. The Four Waterfalls Walk (#1) is unmissable, and walking behind Sgwd yr Eira is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Visit after rain for maximum drama."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you walk in the Brecon Beacons with dogs?",
      "answer": "Yes — all walks on this list are dog-friendly, though leads are required near livestock (common on the mountains). Talybont Reservoir (#9) and the waterfall walks are particularly good for dogs. Note that the Pen y Fan paths can be very busy with other dogs in summer."
