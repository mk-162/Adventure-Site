Watch spectacular penguin feeds, marvel at the lion pride, and get close to giraffes, rhinos and meerkats at the award-winning zoo. The Jolly Barn offers hands-on farmyard experiences with daily animal handling sessions, while the vintage fairground spins with traditional fun. Adventure playgrounds, the Pembrokeshire Wheel and indoor soft play ensure non-stop entertainment. Summer brings extended opening hours, special keeper talks, and additional outdoor activities.
