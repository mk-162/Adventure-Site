# What should I expect on your first Mountain Biking experience?

## Quick Answer

Expect a thrilling mix of adrenaline and challenge! Your first time will likely involve learning basic techniques, navigating uneven terrain, and getting a good workout. Don't be surprised if you feel a bit wobbly at first, but with the right guidance and a suitable trail, you'll quickly gain confidence.

## Gearing Up for Your First Ride

Mountain biking in Wales offers diverse experiences, from gentle forest trails to challenging downhill tracks. For beginners, starting with a guided session is highly recommended. Operators like Antur Stiniog in Blaenau Ffestiniog offer introductory courses and bike hire, with prices starting around £60 for a half-day session including equipment. They'll equip you with a suitable bike, helmet, and pads, and teach you essential skills like braking, shifting gears, and body positioning. Alternatively, consider a cross-country trail at Coed Llandegla Forest, where the "Green" graded trails are perfect for novices. Expect to encounter some uphill sections, so pace yourself and don't be afraid to walk if needed.

- Check the weather forecast before you go and dress accordingly. Welsh weather can change quickly, so layers are essential.
- Book your session in advance, especially during peak season (April-September).
- Be aware that trail conditions can vary depending on the weather. After heavy rain, some trails may be muddy and slippery.
- If you're heading to Afan Forest Park, park at the visitor centre and grab a trail map. It's easy to get disoriented on the extensive network of trails.
