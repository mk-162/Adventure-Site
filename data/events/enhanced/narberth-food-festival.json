  "description": "Now in its 26th year, Narberth Food Festival is one of Wales's longest-established and friendliest food celebrations. Set alongside the Town Moor in the heart of this charming Pembrokeshire market town, the two-day event brings together passionate local producers, guest chefs demonstrating their skills, and live music throughout the weekend. Run entirely by volunteers as a not-for-profit event, it embodies the community spirit of Welsh food culture. The festival site connects seamlessly with Narberth's award-winning high street, packed with independent shops, cafes, and restaurants. Free park and ride facilities ensure easy access. The festival showcases the best of Pembrokeshire's food scene, from artisan producers to local restaurants and cafes. Live entertainment and activities for children make this a perfect family day out.",
