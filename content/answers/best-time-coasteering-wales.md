# What is the best time of year for Coasteering in Wales?

## Quick Answer

The best time for coasteering in Wales is generally between May and September. During these months, the water is warmer, the weather is more predictable, and most coasteering operators like TYF Adventure in Pembrokeshire run regular trips. However, even in summer, be prepared for variable conditions, as the Welsh coast can be unpredictable!

## Prime Coasteering Season in Wales

The peak season for coasteering aligns with the warmer months, offering the most comfortable conditions for this exhilarating activity. From May to September, sea temperatures around the Welsh coast tend to be at their highest, usually ranging from 12°C to 16°C, making the plunge into the water less daunting. Operators like Celtic Quest Coasteering, based in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, run daily trips during these months, catering to various skill levels, with prices typically ranging from £45 to £75 per person. This period also benefits from longer daylight hours, allowing for extended coasteering sessions and the chance to explore more of the rugged coastline.

However, it's crucial to remember that Wales is known for its changeable weather. Even in the height of summer, a wetsuit is essential, and it's wise to check the forecast before heading out. Some operators provide thicker wetsuits or even hooded versions during cooler spells. Tides also play a significant role; coasteering is best done during mid to low tide, allowing access to more of the coastline and safer navigation around rocks and gullies. Always check tide times for your chosen location.

## Shoulder Season Coasteering

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Summer (May-Sept) | Warmer water, longer days | Beginner to Advanced | Pembrokeshire, Gower, Anglesey |
| Spring/Autumn (Apr & Oct) | Fewer crowds, crisp air | Intermediate to Advanced | Pembrokeshire, Gower |

Coasteering during the shoulder seasons (April and October) can be a rewarding experience for those willing to brave slightly cooler temperatures. While the water will be chillier, you'll often encounter fewer crowds and benefit from potentially lower prices. Operators like Adventure Beyond in Gower offer trips during these months, often with smaller group sizes, allowing for a more personalized experience. However, it's essential to be prepared for potentially rougher sea conditions and ensure the operator provides adequate thermal protection, such as thicker wetsuits or neoprene layers. Visibility can also be affected by weather conditions, so checking the forecast and consulting with the operator is crucial.

## Practical Tips

- Ask the operator about wetsuit thickness. A 5mm wetsuit is preferable, especially outside of the peak summer months.
- Check the tide times for your specific location. Low to mid-tide is generally best for coasteering. Magicseaweed is a good resource.
- Wear appropriate footwear. Old trainers or wetsuit boots with good grip are essential.
- Book in advance, especially during peak season, to secure your spot with popular operators like TYF Adventure.
- Be honest about your swimming ability and fitness level when booking to ensure the trip is suitable for you.
