  "introduction": "Pembrokeshire, with its dramatic coastline and exposure to the Atlantic, is arguably the best spot in Wales for surfing. Forget the manicured beaches of Cornwall – here, you'll find a wilder, more rugged experience. While Snowdonia might boast mountains, Pembrokeshire lays claim to some truly epic waves. The best surfing in Pembrokeshire comes from the Atlantic swells that wrap around our exposed headlands, offering waves for all skill levels. \n\nFreshwater West, of course, is the big name. Famous for its powerful, hollow waves, it's a magnet for experienced surfers. But don't let that intimidate you! There are plenty of other spots offering a gentler introduction to the sport. Newgale's expansive beach provides space for beginners, while Whitesands Bay offers consistent, manageable waves. Manorbier is a classic, protected by the castle. \n\nBe warned though, Pembrokeshire surfing isn't always easy. Conditions can change quickly, and the water can be cold, even in summer. Rip currents are common at some beaches (especially Freshwater West), so always check the forecast and heed the lifeguard's advice. \n\nHowever, the rewards are well worth it. Imagine catching a wave with seals watching you from the lineup, or finishing a session with a pint in a cosy pub overlooking the beach. Surfing in Pembrokeshire is more than just a sport, it's an experience that connects you to the raw beauty of the Welsh coast. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a complete beginner, Pembrokeshire has something to offer. Grab your board (or rent one!), and get ready to experience some of the best surfing in Wales.",
