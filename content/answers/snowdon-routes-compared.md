# Which Snowdon Route Should I Take?

## Quick Answer

The best Snowdon route depends on your experience, fitness, and desired challenge. For beginners or those wanting a gentler ascent, the Llanberis Path is the longest but least steep. Experienced hikers seeking a thrill should consider Crib Goch, a challenging scramble with exposed sections, while the Pyg Track and Miner's Track offer a good balance of scenery and moderate difficulty.

## The Detail

Here's a breakdown of popular Snowdon routes to help you choose:

*   **Llanberis Path:** (Easiest, Longest - 9 miles round trip, 3199ft ascent) A gradual, well-maintained path following the old railway line. Suitable for families and less experienced hikers. However, it can get monotonous and very busy.
*   **Pyg Track:** (Moderate - 7 miles round trip, 3166ft ascent) A shorter, more scenic route than Llanberis, starting from Pen-y-Pass. It's rocky in places but offers stunning views.
*   **Miner's Track:** (Moderate - 8 miles round trip, 3166ft ascent) Similar to the Pyg Track but starts on the opposite side of Pen-y-Pass. It's slightly less steep initially but joins the Pyg Track near the summit. Can be boggy in places.
*   **Watkin Path:** (Hardest, Most Scenic - 8 miles round trip, 3330ft ascent) Starts at the lowest elevation, resulting in the largest ascent. Offers varied terrain, including waterfalls and old mine workings. A strenuous but rewarding option.
*   **Snowdon Ranger Path:** (Moderate - 8 miles round trip, 2985ft ascent) A quieter route starting from the Snowdon Ranger Hostel. It's relatively gradual but becomes steeper near the summit.
*   **Crib Goch:** (Extremely Difficult - 7 miles round trip, joins Pyg Track) A knife-edge ridge requiring scrambling experience and a head for heights. Not recommended for beginners or in poor weather. Serious injuries and fatalities occur.

**Considerations:**

*   **Weather:** Snowdon's weather can change rapidly. Check the forecast and be prepared for all conditions, regardless of the season.
*   **Fitness:** Assess your fitness level honestly. Choose a route that matches your capabilities.
*   **Gear:** Wear appropriate footwear, clothing, and carry essential supplies, including water, food, and a map.
*   **Time of Year:** Some routes may be more challenging in winter due to snow and ice. Crib Goch is particularly dangerous in these conditions.
*   **Crowds:** Llanberis Path and Pyg Track are the most popular routes and can get very crowded, especially during peak season. Consider a less popular route for a more peaceful experience.

## The Smart Choice

For a first-time ascent with reasonable fitness, I'd recommend the Pyg Track. It offers great views and a moderate challenge without being overly strenuous. If you are experienced hiker after an adrenaline rush, Crib Goch is unmatched, but be brutally honest about your abilities! If you are looking for a less crowded and still scenic option, the Snowdon Ranger Path could be a good bet. No matter the route, preparation is key.
