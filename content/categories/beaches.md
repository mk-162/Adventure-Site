# Beaches in Wales

Wales has over 200 beaches along 870 miles of coastline, and some of them genuinely rival anything in the Mediterranean — minus the temperature, obviously. From the sweeping golden curve of Rhossili Bay (regularly voted one of Britain's best beaches) to hidden Pembrokeshire coves accessible only by foot, the Welsh coast delivers time and time again.

Two things make Welsh beaches special: they're never far away (no part of Wales is more than 50 miles from the sea) and they're rarely crowded by European standards, even in peak summer. You can have a world-class beach to yourself on a midweek morning in June. Try that in Cornwall.

## The Best Beaches by Region

### Gower Peninsula (Best for Variety)
The Gower was Britain's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and it earned the title largely on the strength of its beaches. Within a few miles you've got surfing beaches, family bays, hidden coves, and jaw-dropping cliff-backed stretches. [Explore the Gower](/gower)

- **Rhossili Bay** — Three miles of golden sand backed by dramatic cliffs. Regularly in "best beaches in Britain" lists and it deserves every accolade. Great for surfing at the north end (Llangennith), spectacular walking at the south. Worm's Head is accessible at low tide for a dramatic scramble — but check the tide tables carefully or you'll be stranded for hours.
- **Three Cliffs Bay** — Arguably the most photographed beach in Wales. Three dramatic limestone pinnacles frame a sandy bay, with a stream winding through the sand at low tide. Access requires a 15-minute walk, which keeps it blissfully quiet. The tide comes in FAST here — don't get caught out at the base of the cliffs.
- **Oxwich Bay** — Spacious sandy beach with dunes behind. More facilities than some Gower beaches — café, toilets, good parking. Popular with families and rightly so.
- **Caswell Bay** — Compact, family-friendly, easy parking. Gets busy at high tide when the sand shrinks. Excellent rock pools for kids at low tide.
- **Mewslade Bay** — Hidden gem. Requires a walk from Pitton. Dramatic cliffs, wild atmosphere, never crowded. Not for families with small children (the access is steep) but perfect for those wanting solitude.

### Pembrokeshire (Best for Coast Path Access)
Over 50 beaches, many Blue Flag standard. The Coast Path connects them all — you could beach-hop for a week and barely scratch the surface. [Explore Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire)

- **Barafundle Bay** — Often called the best beach in Wales, and the competition is fierce. Short walk from the car park at Stackpole Quay. No facilities, no access road — just perfect sand and turquoise water in a sheltered cove. Arrive early on summer weekends.
- **Freshwater West** — Wild, exposed surfing beach. Featured in Harry Potter (Shell Cottage). Strong currents — absolutely not for casual swimmers. Beautiful and dramatic but demands respect.
- **Whitesands (Traeth Mawr)** — Near St David's. Popular surfing beach with RNLI lifeguards in summer. Good café. Consistent waves and a stunning backdrop.
- **Broad Haven South** — Beautiful National Trust beach near Stackpole. Family-friendly with excellent rock pools and the lily ponds nearby.
- **Tenby beaches** — Castle Beach, North Beach and South Beach. Classic seaside town beaches with facilities, harbour views and colourful Georgian houses as a backdrop. Proper bucket-and-spade territory.

### Anglesey (Best for Remoteness)
- **Newborough/Llanddwyn** — Vast sandy beach with views across to Snowdonia that stop you in your tracks. Llanddwyn Island at one end (accessible at low tide) is magical — ruins of a 16th-century church, a lighthouse, legends of the Welsh patron saint of lovers. Allow a whole day here.
- **Trearddur Bay** — Sheltered, family-friendly, good facilities. The go-to Anglesey beach for families.
- **Rhosneigr** — Popular with kitesurfers and windsurfers. Great energy, good pub scene. [Explore Anglesey](/anglesey)

### Llŷn Peninsula (Best for Adventure)
- **Porth Oer (Whistling Sands)** — The sand literally squeaks when you walk on it due to the grain shape. Unique and beautiful.
- **Abersoch** — Popular sailing and watersports hub with several beaches and a lively village.

### North Wales Coast
- **Llandudno** — Classic Victorian seaside. Two beaches (North Shore and West Shore) plus the Great Orme headland for walks and wildlife.

## Top 5 Beaches (If You Can Only Pick)

1. **Rhossili Bay, Gower** — The big one. Three miles, golden sand, dramatic cliffs. If you see one beach in Wales, make it this.
2. **Barafundle Bay, Pembrokeshire** — Perfection in miniature. Worth the walk-in for the turquoise water alone.
3. **Newborough & Llanddwyn, Anglesey** — Epic scale, Snowdonia views, and Llanddwyn Island at the end. A complete experience.
4. **Three Cliffs Bay, Gower** — The most photogenic beach in Wales. That walk in keeps the crowds manageable.
5. **Whitesands Bay, Pembrokeshire** — Golden sand, good surf, lifeguards, café, near St David's. The reliable all-rounder.

## Safety Considerations

Welsh beaches are beautiful but they demand respect. The sea here isn't the Mediterranean — it's colder, more powerful, and the tides are serious.

- **Tides**: Welsh beaches change dramatically between tides. Some (Three Cliffs, Caswell) almost disappear at high water. Others (Rhossili, Newborough) are enormous at low tide. **Always check tide times before you go.** People get cut off every year at Three Cliffs and Worm's Head.
- **Rip currents**: Present at many exposed beaches, particularly Freshwater West, Llangennith and Whitesands. If caught in one, don't fight it — swim parallel to the shore until you're out, then head back in.
- **Lifeguards**: RNLI lifeguards patrol many popular beaches May–September. **Always swim between the red and yellow flags.** Check the RNLI website for which beaches are lifeguarded.
- **Water temperature**: 10–16°C typically. July and August are warmest but still bracing. A wetsuit makes a massive difference if you want to spend more than 10 minutes in the water.
- **Cliffs**: Stay well back from cliff edges, and don't shelter at the base — rockfalls happen.

## Practical Tips

- **Parking**: Most popular beaches charge £3–8 for parking in summer. National Trust beaches are free for members — a membership pays for itself in a week of Welsh beach-hopping. Arrive before 10am in July/August or you'll be circling the car park.
- **Dogs**: Many beaches restrict dogs during summer months (typically May–September). Check local signs. Off-season, dogs are welcome almost everywhere and Welsh beaches are brilliant for dog walks.
- **Facilities**: Range from nothing at all (Barafundle, Mewslade) to full amenities (Tenby, Oxwich). Pack what you need for the walk-in beaches — food, water, sun cream, wind shelter.
- **Wind shelter**: Welsh beaches can be breezy even on sunny days. A pop-up windbreak is the single most useful item you can bring.

## Best Time to Visit

- **Late spring (May–June)**: Warming up, beaches relatively quiet, wildflowers on the cliffs. Water still cold but the air temperature is pleasant.
- **Summer (July–August)**: Warmest water and air. Busiest period. Arrive early for parking at popular spots. Lifeguards on duty.
- **September**: Arguably the sweet spot. Often warm, significantly less crowded, sea at its warmest after a summer of heating up. Lifeguards still present at many beaches. If you can only come once, make it September.
- **Autumn/Winter**: Quiet, dramatic, beautiful on clear days. The Gower and Pembrokeshire coastal walks are stunning in low autumn light. Wrap up, bring a thermos, enjoy having a world-class beach to yourself.

## Who It's For

Everyone. That's the honest answer and it happens to be true. Welsh beaches range from gentle sandy bays perfect for toddlers (Oxwich, Caswell, Trearddur) to wild surf beaches for experienced water users (Freshwater West, Llangennith) to remote coves for those who just want to be left alone with a book and the sound of waves (Mewslade, Barafundle). Couples, families, groups, solo walkers — the coast doesn't discriminate. Just bring a jumper.
