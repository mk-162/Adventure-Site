# About Pembrokeshire

Pembrokeshire's raw beauty is undeniable. This isn't manicured coastline; this is a land forged by relentless waves and sculpted by the wind. Think towering sea cliffs, hidden coves, and golden beaches that stretch for miles. It's a place where the Welsh language thrives, and the spirit of adventure runs deep. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail hugs the entire coastline, offering breathtaking views and access to some of the best outdoor activities in the UK.

Adventure seekers flock here for the thrill of the ocean. The Atlantic swells create world-class surfing conditions, while the rugged coastline provides the perfect playground for coasteering and sea kayaking. Inland, you'll find craggy peaks offering challenging climbs and tranquil valleys perfect for exploring on foot or by bike. The vibe here is laid-back but energetic, a place where you can find both solitude and camaraderie with fellow adventurers.

## Best For

- **Coasteering:** Pembrokeshire is the birthplace of coasteering, offering unparalleled opportunities for scrambling, swimming, and cliff jumping.
- **Sea Kayaking:** Explore hidden coves, spot seals, and paddle through dramatic sea caves along the stunning coastline.
- **Wildlife Boat Tours:** Head out to Ramsey Island to witness seabird colonies, seals, and maybe even a glimpse of porpoises.

## Best Time to Visit

The best time to visit Pembrokeshire for outdoor activities is between May and September. During these months, the weather is generally milder, with warmer sea temperatures perfect for watersports. July and August are the busiest months, so expect larger crowds, particularly in popular destinations like Tenby and St Davids.

Spring (April-May) offers fewer crowds and blooming wildflowers, while autumn (September-October) can bring stunning coastal scenery and fewer tourists. Be aware that some boat trips and seasonal businesses may operate on a reduced schedule outside of peak season. Winter can be wild and unpredictable, with many businesses closed.

Driving times from major UK cities:

## Pro Tips

- **Book activities in advance:** Especially during peak season, popular activities like coasteering and boat trips fill up quickly.
