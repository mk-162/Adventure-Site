Spring in Wales is a time of rebirth, when the landscape explodes with colour and the weather begins to warm. It's a magical time to explore the country's diverse terrain, from the rugged mountains of Snowdonia to the dramatic coastline of Pembrokeshire. Longer days and fewer crowds compared to the summer months make it an ideal time for adventure.

Imagine hiking through valleys carpeted in wildflowers, feeling the thrill of the first sea kayak of the season, or challenging yourself with a mountain bike trail as the forests come alive. Spring offers a unique blend of invigorating activity and stunning natural beauty, making it a perfect season for creating unforgettable memories. Whether you're a seasoned adventurer or trying something new, Wales in Spring has something for everyone.

## Crowds & Booking

Spring is generally less crowded than the peak summer months, but it's still advisable to book popular activities and accommodation in advance, especially during school holidays and weekends. This is particularly important for activities like Velocity 2, coasteering, and guided walks, which often have limited spaces. Booking ahead will guarantee your spot and allow you to plan your trip with peace of mind.

## Seasonal Events

*   **St David's Day (March 1st):** Celebrate Welsh culture with parades and festivities throughout the country.
*   **Hay Festival (Late May/Early June):** While technically slightly outside the Spring window, book early for accommodation and tickets for this world-renowned literary festival in Hay-on-Wye.

## Insider Tips

- Look out for the spring lambs in the countryside! Keep dogs on leads near livestock.
- Wildflowers are at their peak in late spring. Enjoy the colourful displays in meadows and along coastal paths.
- Consider visiting mid-week to avoid weekend crowds, especially at popular attractions.
