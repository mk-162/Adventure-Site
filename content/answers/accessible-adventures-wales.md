# Are There Accessible Outdoor Activities in Wales?

Yes — and more than you'd think. From wheelchair-accessible zip lines and adaptive surfing to flat-terrain forest trails and beach wheelchairs, Wales has made real progress in opening up adventure to everyone.

## What's Actually Available

### Zip World — Genuinely Inclusive

Zip World in [North Wales](/north-wales) deserves credit here. Their Velocity 2 zip line — the fastest in the world — can accommodate many wheelchair users and people with physical disabilities. The team are experienced at adapting harnesses and transfers. Contact them directly to discuss your specific needs, but their attitude is "let's find a way to make it work" rather than ticking boxes. Fforest Coaster and Bounce Below also have accessibility options. Prices from £25–£85.

### Adaptive Surfing

Surfability UK, based on the [Gower](/gower), is a charity that provides adapted surfing sessions for people with physical and neurological disabilities. They use specialist beach wheelchairs, adapted boards, and trained volunteers. Sessions run from Caswell Bay and are either free or low-cost. This is genuinely excellent and worth travelling for.

### Accessible Trails

**Coed y Brenin, Snowdonia** — Several all-ability trails with firm, graded surfaces suitable for wheelchairs and mobility scooters. The visitor centre has accessible facilities. Free entry.

**Brecon Beacons** — The Taff Trail offers long stretches of flat, well-surfaced path. The waterfall country area has some accessible viewpoints, though the gorge trails themselves are not suitable.

**Bute Park and Taff Trail, Cardiff** — Flat, paved, and beautiful. A surprisingly good urban adventure for wheeled access.

**Newborough Forest, Anglesey** — Flat forest trails with wheelchair-accessible paths leading to Llanddwyn Island at low tide. Stunning scenery in [Anglesey](/anglesey).

### Beach Wheelchairs

Several Welsh beaches now provide free beach wheelchair hire:

- **Rhossili Bay, Gower** — Beach wheelchair available from the National Trust visitor centre
- **Tenby beaches, Pembrokeshire** — Contact the council for availability
- **Newgale, Pembrokeshire** — Beach wheelchairs available seasonally
- **Barmouth, Snowdonia** — Beach wheelchair loan scheme

These make a genuine difference — the Welsh coast is too good to only experience from the promenade.

### Guided Experiences for Mixed-Ability Groups

Some adventure operators are increasingly flexible about adapting sessions. It's always worth asking, even if accessibility isn't mentioned on their website. Operators in [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire) including TYF and Preseli Venture have experience adapting coasteering and kayaking for people with various disabilities — the key is calling ahead and having an honest conversation about what you need.

## Planning Tips

**Call, don't just email.** A phone conversation about your specific needs gets better results than a web form. Most Welsh operators are small teams who genuinely want to help but need to understand what's required.

**Book ahead.** Adapted equipment and extra support staff often need advance arrangement. Two weeks minimum, more in summer.

**Check the Accessible Wales website** for accommodation with proper accessibility assessments — not just "ground floor room available."

**Be specific about your needs.** "Wheelchair user" covers a huge range. The more detail you give operators, the better they can plan.
