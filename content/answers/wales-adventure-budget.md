# How Much Does an Adventure Holiday in Wales Cost?

A long weekend of proper adventure in Wales runs £150–£400 per person depending on how you sleep and what you do. Budget camping and free hikes at one end, guided multi-activity packages with a nice Airbnb at the other.

## Accommodation

**Camping:** £10–£25 per night at proper campsites. Wild camping is technically not legal in Wales (unlike Scotland), but informal bivvying on open land away from habitation is widely tolerated if you're sensible about it — free, obviously.

**Hostels & Bunkhouses:** £20–£40 per night. YHA hostels in Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons are excellent and well-placed for adventure. Independent bunkhouses like Plas Curig near Capel Curig are popular with outdoor groups.

**B&Bs & Guesthouses:** £40–£80 per night for a double room. Betws-y-Coed, Brecon, and St Davids all have good options.

**Holiday Cottages & Airbnbs:** £80–£200 per night for a 2–4 person place. Split between mates, this can be very reasonable. Best value outside school holidays.

**Glamping:** £70–£150 per night for yurts, pods, or shepherds' huts. Growing fast across Wales, especially in [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire) and [Snowdonia](/snowdonia).

## Money-Saving Tips

**Go off-peak.** September and October are ideal — fewer crowds, lower prices, and the weather's often surprisingly good. Avoid school holidays if you can.

**Book direct.** Most Welsh adventure operators offer better rates when you book through their own website rather than through aggregators.

**Bring your own kit.** If you have a wetsuit, hiking boots, or a bike, bring them. Hire costs add up over a week.

**Self-cater.** Wales has excellent local produce. Most towns have good butchers and farm shops. Cook at your accommodation and save pub dinners for special nights.

**Free adventures.** Hiking, wild swimming, beach days, and cycling quiet lanes cost nothing. Wales has 870 miles of coastline and three national parks — there's no shortage of free things to do.

## Quick Picks

- **Best value activity:** Wild swimming — completely free across [Snowdonia](/snowdonia) and [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire)
- **Best value accommodation:** YHA hostels from £20/night in the [Brecon Beacons](/brecon-beacons) and [Snowdonia](/snowdonia)
- **Best off-peak month:** September — warm enough, quiet, cheaper
- **Best multi-activity deal:** Weekend packages from adventure centres, typically 15–20% cheaper than booking separately
- **Budget long weekend:** Camping + free hikes + one paid activity = under £150pp
