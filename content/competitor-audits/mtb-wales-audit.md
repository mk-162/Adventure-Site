# Wales MTB Competitor Audit

**Date:** 2026-02-06  
**Audited by:** Sudo  
**Purpose:** Understand what Adventure Wales is up against for MTB content

---

## Two Sites, Two Models

There are two "Mountain Bike Wales" sites with very different purposes:

| Site | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **mtb.wales** | Tour Operator | Sells guided multi-day MTB adventures |
| **mbwales.com** | Trail Directory | Official Visit Wales MTB content hub |

Both are relevant benchmarks but for different reasons.

## What They Do Well

### 1. **Authentic Local Expertise**
- Phill & Polly live ON the Trans Cambrian Way (Staylittle)
- 20+ years guiding experience
- Genuine "it's our backyard" credibility
- Associate guides with deep credentials (Dan Cook - British Cycling Leadership Lead)

### 2. **Storytelling & Hiraeth**
> "Many of our riders speak of feeling hiraeth when they leave—a uniquely Welsh word that describes a deep longing for a place once experienced"

This is beautiful copywriting that sells an emotional experience, not just a bike ride.

### 3. **Day-by-Day Route Breakdowns**
Each multi-day route has detailed daily itineraries:
- Distance + climbing per day
- Key landmarks and terrain
- Villages and overnight stops
- What to expect

### 4. **All-Inclusive Pricing**
Clear packages: accommodation, food, transfers, kit transport, guiding. No hidden costs.

### 5. **Press Coverage Integration**
Links to Guardian article about Traws Eryri — third-party validation.

### 6. **E-MTB Specific Content**
Dedicated page for e-bikes with:
- Battery management guidance
- Bike hire options (Trek Rail 5, £80/day)
- Honest notes about which bikes can handle the routes

### 7. **Sponsors & Associations**
Lists partners: Atherton Bikes, Madison, Bikmo, DT Swiss, Vittoria  
Associations: Visit Wales, mbwales.com, Visit Cambrian Mountains

## Weaknesses

1. **Wix Site** — Limited SEO potential, basic structure
2. **Thin Content Pages** — Some route pages are just 1-2 paragraphs
3. **No Trail Database** — No individual trail listings or search
4. **Limited Blog/Content** — Not much ongoing content
5. **No User Reviews** — Testimonials are quotes, not integrated reviews
6. **Mobile Experience** — Wix templates can be clunky

## Relevance to Adventure Wales

**Direct Competitor:** No — they sell guided tours, we're a discovery platform  
**Potential Partner:** YES — they should be listed as an MTB operator  
**Content to Learn From:** Route storytelling, day-by-day breakdowns, hiraeth emotional angle

## What They Do Well

### 1. **Comprehensive Trail Database**
100+ trails with consistent data structure. This is the Ultimate France model for MTB.

### 2. **Clear Grading System**
Colour-coded grades that match UK MTB standards:
- Yellow = Easy
- Green = Beginner
- Blue = Intermediate
- Red = Difficult
- Black = Severe
- Orange = Extreme/Bike Park

### 3. **Trail Centre vs Trail Distinction**
Separates:
- **Centres** (full facilities, multiple trails)
- **Bases** (waymarked trails, local facilities)
- **Individual trails** (specific routes)

### 4. **Photo Galleries Per Trail**
5-7 images per trail showing terrain, views, features.

### 5. **Nearby Trails Feature**
Related trails surfaced at bottom of each listing.

### 6. **Business Registration**
Facilities section lets bike shops, accommodation, etc. register.

### 7. **Trail Updates Section**
Blog-style updates about trail conditions, closures, new builds.

### 8. **Bilingual**
Welsh language toggle (Cymraeg).

## Weaknesses

### 1. **Dated Design**
Site looks 2016-era. Not modern, not mobile-first.

### 2. **Thin Descriptions**
Many trails have just 1-2 sentences:
> "The 4km Bedwen trail is a pleasant tour of the Beddgelert forest."

Compared to Ultimate France's 300+ word descriptions with insider tips, this is weak.

### 3. **No Coordinates/Maps**
No lat/long, no embedded maps, no GPX downloads.

### 4. **No Conditions Data**
No info on:
- Best season
- Surface type
- Drainage (rides well in wet?)
- Wind exposure

### 5. **No User Content**
No reviews, ratings, tips, photos from riders.

### 6. **Blog Abandoned**
Last post: December 2022. Dead content.

### 7. **No Operator Integration**
Doesn't link trails to operators who run sessions there.

### 8. **Missing Key Data**
- No elevation profiles
- No GPS/GPX
- No parking info
- No access notes

# Gap Analysis: Adventure Wales vs Competitors

## What Adventure Wales Has

- Good editorial content
- Operator database (50+ operators)
- Modern tech stack (Next.js)
- Region structure
- Activity categories

## What Adventure Wales Needs (to beat mbwales.com)

### 1. Trail Database
Create `trails.csv` or structured content for every MTB trail:

```csv
slug,name,centre,region,grade,distance_km,climb_m,time_hrs,surface,wet_ok,gpx_url
marin-trail,Marin Trail,gwydir-forest,snowdonia,red,25,800,2-3,rocky-roots,no,/gpx/marin-trail.gpx
```

### 2. Trail Centre Pages
Each trail centre needs a mega-page:
- All trails at that centre with data cards
- Facilities (parking, café, bike wash, hire)
- Getting there (address, postcode, coordinates)
- Opening hours
- Links to operators who run sessions

### 3. Individual Trail Pages
Every trail needs:
- Grade + technical description
- Distance, climbing, time
- Surface type (rocky, roots, hardpack, etc.)
- Best conditions (season, weather)
- Parking location
- Photo gallery
- GPX download
- Linked operators
- User tips/reviews (future)

### 4. Better Data Than mbwales
mbwales has:
- Name, grade, distance, climb, time, area

We should add:
- **Coordinates** (parking + trailhead)
- **Surface type** (rocky, loam, hardpack, gravel)
- **Wet weather suitability** (drains well? muddy? avoid?)
- **Best season** (year-round, avoid winter, summer only)
- **Elevation profile** (image or SVG)
- **GPX download**
- **Strava segment links**
- **Video (YouTube embed)**

### 5. Operator Integration
For each trail/centre, link to operators:
- BikePark Wales → link to BikePark Wales operator page
- Guided rides on Trans Cambrian → link to MTB Wales operator

### 6. Route Content (mtb.wales style)
Multi-day routes need day-by-day breakdowns:
- Trans Cambrian Way
- Traws Eryri
- Sarn Helen
- Lon Las Cymru

Format each like mtb.wales does:
> Day 1: Knighton to Rhayader, 54km, 1200m climbing. Depart Knighton...

# Summary

| Aspect | mtb.wales | mbwales.com | Adventure Wales Target |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Type** | Tour operator | Trail directory | Discovery + directory |
| **Trail count** | 8 routes | 100+ trails | 150+ trails |
| **Trail data** | Narrative | Basic structured | Rich structured |
| **Coordinates** | No | No | Yes |
| **GPX** | No | No | Yes |
| **Operators** | Just themselves | Business listings | Full integration |
| **Reviews** | Quotes | None | Future feature |
| **Content depth** | Deep for their routes | Thin descriptions | Ultimate France depth |
| **Design** | Wix (dated) | 2016 WordPress | Modern Next.js |
| **SEO potential** | Low | Medium | High |

**Bottom line:** mbwales.com has breadth (100+ trails) but lacks depth. Adventure Wales can win by having the same breadth PLUS Ultimate France-style depth, better data, and operator integration.
