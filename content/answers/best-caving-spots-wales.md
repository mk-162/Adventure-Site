# Where are the best Caving locations in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Wales boasts incredible caving, mainly concentrated in the Brecon Beacons National Park. For beginners, head to the easily accessible Porth yr Ogof cave near Ystradfellte. More experienced cavers can explore the challenging cave systems around Dan yr Ogof or join a guided tour with operators like Adventure Britain for a safe and thrilling experience.

## Exploring the Brecon Beacons' Underground Wonders

The Brecon Beacons National Park is the undisputed caving hotspot in Wales, thanks to its limestone geology. Porth yr Ogof, near Ystradfellte, is a popular choice for its impressive entrance and relatively easy exploration, making it suitable for families and those new to caving. However, be aware that the cave can flood quickly after heavy rain, so check conditions beforehand. No permit is required for Porth yr Ogof, but it's essential to be properly equipped with helmets and lights.

For a more structured experience, consider a guided tour with Adventure Britain, based in Brecon. They offer a range of caving adventures, from introductory trips to more advanced expeditions, with prices starting around £60 per person. They provide all the necessary equipment and expert guidance, ensuring a safe and memorable experience. Dan yr Ogof, also known as the National Showcaves Centre for Wales, offers a less strenuous but equally fascinating look at cave formations, with well-lit pathways and guided tours available. Entry to the Showcaves is around £20 for adults.
