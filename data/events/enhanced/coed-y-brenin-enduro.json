  "description": "Coed y Brenin is the birthplace of purpose-built mountain bike trails in the UK, and this enduro puts you on some of Britain's finest singletrack. The format is classic enduro: pedal between stages on flowing liaison trails, then race against the clock on technical descents.

The ancient forest provides a stunning backdrop—towering conifers, rushing rivers, and that unmistakable Welsh woodland atmosphere. Whether you're a seasoned racer or enduro newcomer, Coed y Brenin delivers world-class riding in a legendary location. The venue's world-class trails have hosted national and international mountain biking events, drawing riders from across the UK and Europe to experience some of Wales' finest singletrack.",
