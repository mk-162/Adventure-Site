# How many days should I spend in Gower Peninsula?

## Quick Answer

To truly experience the Gower Peninsula, aim for at least three full days. This allows you to explore iconic beaches like Rhossili Bay and Three Cliffs Bay, hike sections of the Gower Coast Path, and enjoy activities like surfing or coasteering without feeling rushed. For a more in-depth adventure, including exploring the inland villages and castles, consider a five-day trip.

## Crafting Your Gower Itinerary

A three-day trip could look like this: Day one dedicated to the western beaches (Rhossili, Llangennith) and surfing with a local operator like Gower Surf Academy. Day two, hike from Three Cliffs Bay to Oxwich Bay, stopping for lunch at the Oxwich Bay Hotel, known for its seafood. Day three could be spent exploring the Mumbles, with its Victorian pier and boutique shops, finishing with a sunset pint at the Pilot Inn overlooking Swansea Bay.

Extending your stay to five days opens up opportunities for exploring the less-visited northern coast, perhaps with a guided walk from Gower Adventures. You could also delve into the peninsula's history with a visit to Weobley Castle (£6 entry), or take a foraging course with Coastal Foraging to learn about the local edible plants and seaweeds. Remember that Gower's popularity means booking accommodation, especially in peak season (June-August), is essential. Expect to pay £80-£150 per night for a decent B&B or guesthouse.

## Practical Tips

- Check the tide times before planning a beach visit, especially to Rhossili Bay, as the causeway to Worm's Head is only accessible at low tide. Allow ample time for the return journey to avoid getting stranded.
- Parking at popular beaches like Three Cliffs Bay can be limited, especially during peak season. Arrive early or consider using the Gower Explorer bus service.
- Pack for all weather conditions, even in summer. Gower's coastal location means sudden changes in weather are common. A waterproof jacket and sturdy walking shoes are essential.
- Book activities like surfing lessons or coasteering in advance, particularly during school holidays, to avoid disappointment.
