# What are the Best Beaches in Pembrokeshire?

## Quick Answer

Pembrokeshire boasts a huge variety of beaches, so the "best" depends on what you're after! For families and classic seaside fun, head to Tenby South or Barafundle Bay. If you're looking for surf, consider Freshwater West or Whitesands Bay.

## The Detail

Pembrokeshire's coastline is incredibly diverse, offering something for everyone. Here's a breakdown:

*   **For Families:**
    *   **Tenby South:** A long, sandy beach backed by dunes, perfect for building sandcastles. Calm waters make it ideal for swimming. Close to Tenby town for amenities.
    *   **Barafundle Bay:** Often cited as one of the UK's best, this secluded bay requires a short walk from the car park, keeping it relatively quiet. Golden sands and clear waters.
    *   **Broad Haven South:** Another family-friendly option with a wide sandy beach, rock pools at low tide, and the iconic Church Rock.

*   **For Surfers:**
    *   **Freshwater West:** A consistent and powerful beach break, popular with experienced surfers. This is where they filmed some scenes for Harry Potter, so it can get busy. Strong currents make it unsuitable for beginners.
    *   **Whitesands Bay:** A more beginner-friendly surf beach with a surf school on-site. Sheltered bay with golden sands and stunning views of Ramsey Island.
    *   **Manorbier:** Good surf spot, particularly at high tide. Has a stunning backdrop with Manorbier Castle overlooking the bay.

*   **For Coasteering & Adventure Activities:**
    *   **Blue Lagoon (Abereiddi):** Famous for coasteering, this former slate quarry filled with sea water offers deep water jumps and exhilarating swims. (We run Coasteering trips here!)
    *   **Porthclais Harbour:** A small, sheltered harbour perfect for launching sea kayaks or paddleboards. Explore the rugged coastline and nearby caves.
    *   **St Non's Bay:** Rocky coastline offering amazing spots for wild swimming and coasteering.

*   **For Wildlife Spotting:**
    *   **Marloes Sands:** A vast, dramatic beach with interesting rock formations and abundant wildlife. Look out for seals and seabirds.
    *   **Stackpole Quay:** A great starting point for boat trips to Ramsey Island to see seals, seabirds and even dolphins.

## The Smart Choice

If I'm taking the family for a traditional beach day, I'd choose Tenby South for its convenience and calm waters. If I'm after an adrenaline fix, I'd head to the Blue Lagoon for a coasteering session. Surfers should check the forecast and head to Freshwater West if experienced, or Whitesands for something more manageable.
