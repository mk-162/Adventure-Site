# Best Caves in the Brecon Beacons: A Local's Guide

The Brecon Beacons (now officially Bannau Brycheiniog) sits on a band of Carboniferous limestone that makes it the caving capital of Wales. From show caves with underground waterfalls to serious expedition systems that rank among Britain's deepest, here's where to go and what to expect.

## Why the Brecon Beacons?

The geology is perfect. Three hundred million years of water dissolving limestone has carved out a network of over 300 caves beneath these hills. The area around the Upper Swansea Valley—between Ystradgynlais and Ystradfellte—contains some of the most significant cave systems in Britain.

This isn't just local boosterism. Ogof Ffynnon Ddu is Britain's deepest cave. Dan-yr-Ogof is Wales's most impressive show cave. Porth yr Ogof has the largest cave entrance in the country. If you want to go underground in Wales, this is where you come.

## The Big Three

### 1. Dan-yr-Ogof National Showcaves Centre

**Type:** Show cave (commercial attraction)  
**Location:** Near Abercraf, SA9 1GJ  
**Getting There:** Off the A4067 between Ystradgynlais and Sennybridge  
**Parking:** Large car park on site

This is Wales's premier show cave—three caves, actually, each offering something different:

**Dan-yr-Ogof** is the main event: nearly a kilometre of decorated passages with stalactites, stalagmites, and flowstone formations. You walk on a paved path with good lighting throughout. The formations are genuinely impressive, not the tacky overlit tourist stuff you might expect.

**Cathedral Cave** features the Dome of St Paul's—a massive chamber with 40-foot underground waterfalls. It's appropriately named; the scale is ecclesiastical. This is where you'll spend most of your photography time.

**Bone Cave** is the eerie one. Excavations revealed 42 human skeletons alongside bones of bears, wolves, and other animals. The displays explain the history—people used this cave for thousands of years.

The site also includes a dinosaur park (250+ life-sized models), Iron Age village, museum, and various other attractions. It leans family-friendly, but the caves themselves are the real draw.

**Practical Details:**
- Tickets must be pre-booked online
- Allow a full day
- Dress warmly—caves maintain constant 10°C
- Not pushchair-friendly (baby carriers fine)
- The walk to Bone Cave involves proper uphill hiking

**Honest Assessment:** Touristy, yes. The dinosaurs are there to keep kids entertained. But the caves are spectacular, and the geology is completely real. Worth doing once, especially with children.

### 2. Porth yr Ogof

**Type:** Adventure caving / natural feature  
**Location:** Near Ystradfellte, CF44 9JE  
**Getting There:** Cwm Porth car park (National Park managed), short walk to cave entrance  
**Parking:** Pay and display at Cwm Porth

This is where adventure caving in Wales happens. Porth yr Ogof (Gateway to the Cave) has the largest cave entrance in Wales—17 metres wide and 5 metres tall—where the Afon Mellte river plunges underground for 300 metres before resurfacing at the Blue Pool.

The entrance itself is free to visit and worth seeing even if you don't go caving. Walk down from the car park, cross the (usually dry) riverbed, and you're standing at the maw of Wales's biggest cave. On a dry day, you can venture a short way inside with a torch without special equipment.

But the real experience is adventure caving with a guide. The cave has an extensive maze system behind the main passage, with features nicknamed the Letterbox, the Washing Machine, Death Ledge, and Rat Trap. You'll crawl, wade, scramble, and squeeze. You'll get muddy. You'll love it.

**Safety Warning:** Several deaths have occurred at the exit resurgence (Blue Pool). The water is deep, cold, and has dangerous undercuts. Never attempt to cross it. Warning signs mark safer exits via other passages—follow them, or better yet, go with a guide who knows the system.

**Operators:**
- Black Mountain Adventure (45-85 GBP)
- Hawk Adventures
- Gower Adventures

**Practical Details:**
- Minimum age typically 8 for adventure trips
- Trips last 3-4 hours
- All equipment provided
- Bring old clothes and a full change for afterwards

**Honest Assessment:** The defining Welsh caving experience. The entrance is accessible to anyone; the adventure trips suit beginners and experienced cavers alike. Go with a guide for the full experience.

### 3. Ogof Ffynnon Ddu (OFD)

**Type:** Serious adventure caving (permit required)  
**Location:** Near Penwyllt, above the Upper Swansea Valley  
**Access:** Controlled by South Wales Caving Club

This is the big one—literally. OFD is Britain's deepest cave (274 metres) and the second-longest in Wales (over 50 kilometres surveyed). It's a labyrinthine system of passages, streamways, chambers, pitches, and squeezes across multiple levels.

OFD is not for beginners. The main entrances are gated and require permission from the South Wales Caving Club. Even with access, you need experience navigating complex cave systems, dealing with vertical rope work, and managing the very real risks of getting lost in passages that all look the same.

But if you've been bitten by the caving bug, this is where you want to end up. Through-trips from the top entrance to the bottom take experienced groups 6-10 hours. The formations include some of the finest in Britain. The scale is genuinely impressive.

**How to Access:**
- Join a caving club affiliated with the British Caving Association
- Build experience on guided beginner trips first
- Contact SWCC for permit arrangements (www.swcc.org.uk)

**Honest Assessment:** Most visitors won't go here—that's fine. But knowing it exists, beneath these hills, adds something to the landscape. If you progress in caving, OFD is the aspiration.

## Other Caves Worth Knowing

### Eglwys Faen

A slightly easier alternative to Porth yr Ogof, with larger passages and fewer serious squeezes. Often used for family groups, school trips, and beginners who want a gentler introduction. Several operators offer trips here as an alternative or in combination with Porth yr Ogof.

### Ogof Clogwyn

Another beginner-friendly system sometimes used for youth groups and introductory trips. Access requires keys from the SWCC, so you'll need to go with an operator or club.

### Craig y Nos / Agen Allwedd

Advanced systems requiring permits and serious experience. Mentioned here for completeness—if you know what these are, you don't need this guide.

## The Four Waterfalls Walk Connection

Porth yr Ogof sits at the start of the famous Four Waterfalls Walk (Sgwd Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd Isaf Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd y Pannwr, and Sgwd yr Eira). You can combine a morning looking at the cave entrance with an afternoon walking to the waterfalls—it's a brilliant full day out.

The waterfalls are spectacular in their own right, and Sgwd yr Eira (Fall of Snow) lets you walk behind the waterfall. Start at Cwm Porth car park, see the cave, then hike to the falls. Four to five hours, moderate difficulty, proper boots required.

## Seasonal Considerations

**Summer:** Caves offer cool escape from heat (rare in Wales, but it happens). Can be busier with school groups at show caves.

**Winter:** Cave temperature is constant year-round, so underground is actually warmer than outside. Water levels may be higher after rain.

**After Heavy Rain:** Water levels in caves rise dramatically. The River Mellte at Porth yr Ogof can transform from a trickle to a torrent within hours. Operators monitor conditions and will cancel if unsafe. If you're exploring the entrance area independently, check the weather forecast.

## Getting There

The main caving area centres on the Upper Swansea Valley:

**By Car:** A4067 from Swansea or Sennybridge. For Porth yr Ogof, follow signs to Ystradfellte and Cwm Porth.

**By Public Transport:** Difficult. Limited bus services reach the valleys; a car is really necessary for cave access.

**Parking:** Cwm Porth has a large pay-and-display car park (National Park managed). Dan-yr-Ogof has on-site parking. OFD access is via private land belonging to SWCC.

## Final Thoughts

The Brecon Beacons contains more underground adventure per square mile than anywhere else in Wales. You can stand at the entrance of Britain's largest cave, walk through show caves with 40-foot waterfalls, or (eventually) explore some of the country's most significant cave systems.

Start at Porth yr Ogof. Book a trip with one of the local operators. Get muddy. See if you like it. Most people emerge from their first proper caving trip either hooked or certain they never want to do it again—there's rarely a middle ground.

Either way, you'll have experienced something that most people never do. And that's worth the mud.
