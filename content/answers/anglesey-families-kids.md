# Is Anglesey good for families with children?

## Quick Answer

Absolutely! Anglesey (Ynys Môn) is fantastic for families, offering everything from sandy beaches like Llanddwyn (Newborough) to thrilling coasteering adventures with operators like Anglesey Adventures in Menai Bridge. You'll find plenty to keep kids of all ages entertained, whatever the weather.

## Beach Days and Coastal Exploring

Anglesey boasts some of the best beaches in Wales, perfect for family days out. Llanddwyn Beach, backed by Newborough Forest, offers miles of golden sand and shallow waters ideal for paddling. Keep an eye out for the legendary Dwynwen's Island at the far end! For rock pooling, head to Porth Swtan (Church Bay) on the north coast, where you can hunt for crabs and starfish. During the summer months, expect to pay around £5 for parking at popular beaches. For a more adventurous beach experience, consider a family-friendly coasteering session with Anglesey Adventures; prices start from around £45 per person.

## Adventures Beyond the Beach

Beyond the beaches, Anglesey offers a range of activities to suit all ages. Visit Beaumaris Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and let the kids explore its impressive towers and battlements. Entry is around £8 per adult and £6 per child. For animal lovers, the Foel Farm Park near Brynsiencyn offers a chance to meet and feed farm animals; tickets are approximately £8 per adult and £7 per child. If you're looking for something more active, try cycling the traffic-free section of the Anglesey Coastal Path between Holyhead and Trearddur Bay, offering stunning views and relatively easy terrain.
