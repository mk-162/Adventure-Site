  // Introduction - compelling editorial (3-4 paragraphs)
  introduction: `Wales packs more walking variety into its compact borders than anywhere else in Britain. Three National Parks — Eryri (Snowdonia), Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons), and Pembrokeshire Coast — offer everything from scrambles up knife-edge ridges to gentle waterfall trails. Add 870 miles of continuous coastal path, ancient pilgrimage routes, and over a dozen peaks topping 3,000 feet, and you've got a lifetime of walking without repeating a step.

Snowdon draws the crowds — and deservedly so. At 1,085 metres, Yr Wyddfa (its Welsh name) is the highest peak in England and Wales, with six routes ranging from the steady Llanberis Path to the exposed scramble of Crib Goch. But seasoned Welsh walkers know the true magic lies beyond the headlines: Cadair Idris's mystical ridge, Tryfan's rocky tower, the Carneddau's wild ponies, or the haunting beauty of the Cambrian Mountains where you can walk all day without seeing another soul.

The Pembrokeshire Coast Path isn't just Britain's finest coastal trail — it's one of the world's best. 186 miles of dramatic cliffs, hidden coves, and clifftop wildflowers connecting ancient fishing villages. The Brecon Beacons offer a gentler introduction with classic horseshoe routes around Pen y Fan, while the Offa's Dyke Path follows the ancient border for 177 miles of history and landscape.

What makes Welsh walking special isn't just the scenery — it's the accessibility. Unlike the Alps or Highlands, most peaks can be climbed in a day from nearby villages. You can summit Snowdon and be in a pub by teatime. But don't let the convenience fool you: Welsh mountains demand respect. The weather changes fast, paths get rough, and every year Mountain Rescue carries out hundreds of call-outs. Come prepared, and Wales rewards you with experiences that rival anywhere on earth.`,

  // FAQs
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What's the best route up Snowdon for beginners?",
      answer: "The Llanberis Path is the longest but most gradual, making it the 'easiest' option. However, all Snowdon routes are graded as strenuous by the National Park. For complete beginners, consider Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons or Sugar Loaf as better introduction mountains.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need special equipment for hiking in Wales?",
      answer: "Yes — proper walking boots, waterproof layers, map/compass, and warm clothing are essential for mountain walks. Welsh weather changes rapidly and peaks are cold even in summer. Low-level walks on maintained paths can be done with sturdy trainers and a rain jacket.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Crib Goch dangerous?",
      answer: "Yes. Crib Goch is a Grade 1 scramble with serious exposure on a knife-edge ridge. Falls are frequently fatal. It should only be attempted by experienced scramblers in good weather conditions. If you have to ask if you're ready, you're not ready.",
    },
    {
      question: "When is the best time to hike in Wales?",
      answer: "May to September offers the best weather and longest days. September is particularly good — summer warmth lingers with fewer crowds. Winter walking is possible but high peaks require mountaineering skills and equipment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I wild camp in Wales?",
      answer: "Legally, wild camping in Wales requires landowner permission. However, it's widely tolerated in remote mountain areas of Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons if you follow Leave No Trace principles: arrive late, leave early, and leave no evidence you were there.",
    },
    {
      question: "How fit do I need to be for Snowdon?",
      answer: "Reasonably fit. The Llanberis Path involves 9 miles and 975m of ascent — equivalent to climbing about 200 flights of stairs. If you can walk 10 miles on hilly terrain without problems, you're probably ready. Build up with shorter walks first.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a café at the top of Snowdon?",
      answer: "Yes — Hafod Eryri is a visitor centre and café at the summit. Opening hours vary seasonally (typically 9am-5pm in summer). It's accessible by the Snowdon Mountain Railway or on foot. Hot drinks and basic food available.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I get lost or injured?",
      answer: "Call 999 and ask for Police, then Mountain Rescue. Give your location as accurately as possible (grid reference if you know it, or describe what you can see). Stay where you are unless in immediate danger. Carry a whistle — 6 blasts is the international distress signal.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take my dog hiking in Wales?",
      answer: "Yes, but be mindful of livestock. Keep dogs on leads near sheep (especially lambing season March-May) and cattle. Some paths cross land where dogs aren't welcome — check before you go. Carry water for your dog and be realistic about their fitness.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to walk the Pembrokeshire Coast Path?",
      answer: "The full 186 miles takes 10-15 days at a typical hiking pace. Many people walk sections over multiple trips. Popular shorter sections include Tenby to Saundersfoot (4 miles, 2-3 hours) or the St Davids Peninsula (various lengths).",
