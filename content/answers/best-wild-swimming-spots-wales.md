# Where are the best Wild Swimming locations in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Wales boasts incredible wild swimming spots, from the crystal-clear waters of Snowdonia's lakes to the rugged coastline of Pembrokeshire. For a tranquil freshwater experience, head to Llyn Ogwen or Llyn Idwal in Eryri (Snowdonia). If you prefer the sea, explore the secluded coves around Stackpole Quay or Barafundle Bay in Pembrokeshire.

## Freshwater Dips in Eryri (Snowdonia)

Eryri offers some of the most stunning freshwater wild swimming locations in Wales. Llyn Ogwen, easily accessible from the A5, is a popular choice with breathtaking mountain views. Be aware that the water can be very cold, even in summer, so a wetsuit is recommended. Llyn Idwal, a short hike from Ogwen, offers a more secluded experience. For a truly wild swim, consider Llyn Glaslyn, nestled beneath Snowdon itself, but be prepared for a challenging hike and icy water.

For guided wild swimming experiences in Eryri, check out companies like RAW Adventures, who offer bespoke sessions tailored to your ability level. Prices typically range from £50-£80 per person for a half-day session. Remember that these lakes are glacial, so water temperatures rarely exceed 15°C.

## Coastal Wild Swimming in Pembrokeshire

Pembrokeshire's coastline is a wild swimmer's paradise, with numerous secluded coves and beaches to explore. Barafundle Bay, often voted one of the UK's best beaches, offers crystal-clear turquoise waters, perfect for a refreshing dip. Stackpole Quay provides access to several sheltered coves, ideal for beginners. For the more adventurous, consider swimming at the Blue Lagoon near Abereiddy, a former slate quarry filled with vibrant blue water – though be mindful of strong currents and submerged rocks.

TYF Adventure, based in St Davids, offers guided coasteering and wild swimming trips along the Pembrokeshire coast, combining swimming with scrambling and cliff jumping. Prices start from around £60 per person. Note that the sea can be unpredictable, so always check tide times and weather conditions before you go.
