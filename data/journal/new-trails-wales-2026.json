Here's a sneak peek at what's coming.\n\n# New Trails and Routes Opening in Wales 2026\n\nGood news, everyone! Wales is about to get even more explorable. 2026 will see a host of new trails opening up across the country, aimed at hikers and mountain bikers alike. I've been sniffing around and got the lowdown on a few of the most promising. So get your boots and tyres ready!\n\n## Coed y Brenin Expansion - Snowdonia\n\n*Tags: mountain-biking, hiking, forest, snowdonia, moderate, challenging, family-friendly, dog-friendly, free-parking*\n\nFirst up, and always a big draw, is Coed y Brenin forest park in Snowdonia. Natural Resources Wales (NRW), who run the place, are adding a significant chunk of new trails – both hiking and mountain biking – for the 2026 season.\n\n**Mountain Bikers:** Expect a brand-new black-graded trail, said to be even more challenging than the notorious Temtiwr. I’ve heard whispers it’ll involve some serious rock gardens and exposure, so this one is definitely *not* for the faint of heart. Novices, stick to the MinorTaur – it's still a blast and less likely to result in a trip to A&E. Parking at Coed y Brenin will likely remain between £2-7 for the day, so factor that in.\n\n**Hikers:** There’s a completely new long-distance hiking route planned that will circumnavigate the entire forest. It’s supposed to take 2-3 days, with potential wild camping spots along the way (though you’ll need to check regulations with NRW before pitching your tent). This sounds like a cracking option for a proper weekend adventure in the Snowdonia mountains. It will be free, though consider the parking costs. This new trail will add to the already numerous walking trails from easy to challenging, including those up mountains, so you'll have options for all fitness and experience levels.\n\n**Honest Assessment:** Coed y Brenin can get *seriously* busy, especially on weekends and during school holidays. Go early or, even better, visit mid-week if you can. Also, the trails can get boggy after heavy rain, so pack accordingly.\n\n## Afan Forest Park - South Wales Valleys\n\n*Tags: mountain-biking, hiking, forest, south-wales-valleys, moderate, challenging, family-friendly, dog-friendly, free-parking*\n\nMoving down south to the valleys, Afan Forest Park is also undergoing a bit of a revamp. They're adding a new section to the already popular \"The Wall\" trail, known for its fast descents and technical features. I reckon this will cement Afan Forest Park's reputation as one of the best mountain biking destinations in South Wales. This area already has a good reputation and this new addition is likely to make it even more appealing.\n\nFor those who prefer two feet to two wheels, there's also a new hiking trail being developed that will take you to some of the park’s lesser-known viewpoints. Expect some steep climbs, but the rewards will be panoramic views of the valleys. Drive time from Cardiff is about 45 minutes, making it an accessible day trip.\n\n**Honest Assessment:** Afan Forest Park is definitely geared more towards mountain biking than hiking, so if you’re primarily a walker, Coed y Brenin might be a better bet. Also, be aware that the weather in the valleys can be unpredictable. Pack waterproofs, even if the forecast looks good.\n\n## Coastal Path Extensions - Pembrokeshire\n\n*Tags: hiking, coastal, pembrokeshire, easy, moderate, dog-friendly, public-transport*\n\nThe Pembrokeshire Coast Path is already a world-beater, but they are extending it further in 2026. A new section will link up some previously unconnected stretches of coastline near St Davids, opening up some truly spectacular scenery.\n\nThis will be a great one for families and less experienced hikers, as it mostly follows relatively flat terrain along the clifftops. The views, of course, are stunning, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to spot seals and seabirds. Public transport is good in this area too, so you can easily do sections of the path without needing a car. If you fancy something more adventurous after your hike, give coasteering with TYF Adventure a try - it's a Pembrokeshire classic.\n\n**Honest Assessment:** The Pembrokeshire Coast Path can get *very* exposed, so be prepared for wind and rain, even in summer. Check the tide times before you set off, as some sections are impassable at high tide. Also, watch out for adders – they’re not usually aggressive, but best to give them a wide berth.\n\n## New Forest Trails - Mid Wales\n\n*Tags: hiking, mountain-biking, forest, mid-wales, easy, moderate, dog-friendly, free-parking*\n\nMid Wales often gets overlooked, but it's got a lot to offer, and there are plans to significantly expand the network of forest trails in the region. These trails will be designed to be accessible to a wide range of abilities, from families with young children to experienced hikers and mountain bikers.\n\nExpect well-maintained paths through ancient woodland, with plenty of opportunities to spot wildlife. This is a great option for those looking for a more peaceful and less crowded alternative to the more popular destinations in Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons.\n\n**Honest Assessment:** Mid Wales can be a bit remote, so make sure you have a reliable map and compass (or GPS) and let someone know your plans before you set off. Also, mobile phone signal can be patchy in some areas.\n\n## Road Cycling Routes - Anglesey\n\n*Tags: cycling, coastal, anglesey, easy, moderate, family-friendly, cafe, toilets, parking*\n\nWhile not strictly trails, several new designated road cycling routes are planned for Anglesey. These routes will take you along quiet country lanes, past stunning coastal scenery, and through charming villages.\n\nAnglesey is relatively flat, making it ideal for cycling, and these new routes will provide a safe and enjoyable way to explore the island. Expect plenty of cafes and pubs along the way, perfect for a mid-ride pit stop.\n\n**Honest Assessment:** Be aware that the roads on Anglesey can be narrow and winding, so take care when cycling, especially on blind corners. Also, the wind can be fierce at times, so be prepared for a headwind!\n\nSo there you have it – a sneak peek at some of the exciting new trails and routes opening up in Wales in 2026. Get planning, get packing, and get ready to explore! And if you're looking for a bigger thrill, why not head over to Snowdonia and give the Velocity 2 Zip Line a go? Or if heights aren't your thing, Bounce Below is a pretty unique experience. Wales has something for everyone, so get out there and enjoy it!",
