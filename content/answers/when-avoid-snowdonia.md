# When should I avoid visiting Snowdonia?

## Quick Answer

Avoid Snowdonia (Eryri) during peak holiday periods like school holidays (especially summer) and bank holiday weekends if you dislike crowds. The Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) trails become extremely busy, and parking at Pen-y-Pass (£10 per day) fills up before dawn. Also, be wary of visiting during severe weather warnings – mountain conditions can change rapidly.

## Peak Season Challenges

Snowdonia's popularity explodes during school holidays and bank holiday weekends. This means trails, particularly those up Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) itself like the Llanberis Path and Miners' Track, become congested, diminishing the sense of wilderness. Expect queues at stiles and bottlenecks on steeper sections. Popular spots like Llyn Ogwen and Swallow Falls are also overrun. Accommodation in towns like Betws-y-Coed and Llanberis books up months in advance, and prices can double or even triple. Campsites such as Gwern Gof Isaf in the Ogwen Valley also require advance booking.

Consider alternative times like early June or mid-September for fewer crowds and pleasant weather. Or, if you're set on visiting during peak season, explore less-traveled areas. For example, instead of Snowdon, try the Glyderau range for challenging hikes with fewer people, or head to the quieter Nantlle Ridge.

## Weather Woes and Winter Conditions

Snowdonia's weather is notoriously unpredictable. Avoid visiting during periods of severe weather warnings issued by the Met Office. High winds, heavy rain, and ice can make mountain trails extremely dangerous, even for experienced hikers. Winter (November to March) brings snow and ice to higher elevations, requiring specialist equipment like crampons and ice axes, as well as avalanche awareness.

Even in summer, be prepared for sudden changes in the weather. Pack waterproofs, warm layers, and check the mountain weather forecast before setting out. Websites like Mountain Weather Information Service (MWIS) provide detailed forecasts specifically for mountainous areas.

## Practical Tips

- Park further away from the main trailheads and use the Sherpa bus service to access popular routes. This avoids parking headaches and reduces traffic congestion.
- Check the Snowdonia National Park Authority website for real-time parking updates at Pen-y-Pass. They often tweet updates on parking availability.
- Book activities like canyoning with operators like TYF Adventure in St. Davids Head well in advance, especially during peak season.
- Always inform someone of your planned route and expected return time, especially when hiking in remote areas.
