  "description": "Swansea Waterfront Winterland transforms Museum Park into a spectacular winter playground, featuring South Wales' most magical festive experience. The 40-metre Big Wheel towers above the site with over 10,000 twinkling lights, offering breathtaking views across Swansea Bay. The undercover ice rink provides a magical skating experience regardless of weather, while thrilling fairground rides including the Moon-dancer, Freak Out, and Ice Jet deliver adrenaline-pumping excitement. New for 2025, the live music stage hosts entertainment Friday through Sunday evenings, and the Christmas Tree maze offers whimsical family fun. The Alpine Bar and cosy heated seating areas provide the perfect spot to warm up with mulled wine and deluxe hot chocolates.",
