  "introduction": "The Gower Peninsula is the closest thing Wales has to a dedicated surf coast. Within 20 miles of Swansea, you've got beach breaks, reef setups, and a handful of secret spots that can produce genuinely world-class waves. Llangennith alone — a three-mile stretch of sand facing the Atlantic — is one of the most consistent surf beaches in the UK.\n\nWhat makes the Gower special is variety. You can check Llangennith for the main swell, drive 15 minutes to Langland for a sheltered reef, then hit Caswell for an evening glass-off. The peninsula's geography means there's almost always somewhere surfable regardless of wind direction.\n\nWater temperature runs 8°C (February) to 17°C (August). Bring a 4/3mm wetsuit April-October, 5/4mm with boots and gloves November-March. The local surf community is tight but welcoming — respect the lineup and you'll get waves.",
  "rankingCriteria": "We've surfed all of these spots across multiple seasons. Rankings factor in wave quality at its best, consistency, crowd levels, and the overall surfing experience. We slightly favour spots that deliver excellent waves more often, rather than spots that are world-class once a year.",
