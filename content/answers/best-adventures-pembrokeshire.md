# What are the best adventure activities in Pembrokeshire?

## Quick Answer

Pembrokeshire's dramatic coastline is perfect for coasteering, surfing, and kayaking. Explore hidden coves with TYF Adventure in St Davids, ride the waves at Whitesands Bay, or hike the Pembrokeshire Coast Path for breathtaking views. For a unique experience, try foraging for seaweed with Coastal Foraging!

## Coasteering and Coastal Exploration

Pembrokeshire is arguably the birthplace of coasteering, and it's an absolute must-do. TYF Adventure in St Davids offers incredible coasteering experiences along the rugged coastline, with prices ranging from £55-£75 per person. You'll scramble over rocks, swim through sea caves, and leap into the clear waters of the Irish Sea. Celtic Quest Coasteering, based near Fishguard, is another excellent option, known for their knowledgeable guides and focus on marine wildlife. Remember that coasteering is tide-dependent, so book in advance and check the conditions. During low tide, consider exploring the rock pools at Broad Haven South, teeming with marine life.

## Surfing and Watersports

Whitesands Bay, near St Davids, is one of the best surfing beaches in Wales, suitable for all levels. Several surf schools operate here, including Ma Simes Surf School, offering lessons and board rentals from around £35. For experienced surfers, Freshwater West offers more challenging waves, but be aware of strong currents and potential hazards. If surfing isn't your thing, try stand-up paddleboarding (SUP) in the calmer waters of the Milford Haven waterway. Several companies offer SUP rentals and guided tours, allowing you to explore the estuary's hidden creeks and inlets. Expect to pay around £25-£40 for a SUP rental.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Coasteering with TYF | Thrill-seekers and nature lovers | Moderate to Challenging | St Davids |
| Surfing at Whitesands | Beginners to intermediate surfers | Easy to Moderate | Whitesands Bay |
| Kayaking Milford Haven | Wildlife enthusiasts and relaxed explorers | Easy | Milford Haven |

## Practical Tips

- Check tide times before planning any coastal activities – many beaches disappear entirely at high tide!
- For a truly unique experience, book a foraging walk with Coastal Foraging. They'll teach you how to identify and harvest edible seaweed and coastal plants.
- Parking at popular beaches like Barafundle Bay can be a nightmare in peak season. Arrive early or consider using the Pembrokeshire Coast Bus service.
- Always wear appropriate footwear for coastal walks – the rocks can be slippery, even in dry weather.
