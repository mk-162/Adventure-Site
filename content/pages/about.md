# About Adventure Wales

We got fed up with adventure websites that tell you everything is "breathtaking" and "unforgettable" but nothing about whether your eight-year-old can actually do it. So we built something better.

Adventure Wales is the honest guide to outdoor activities across Wales. We cover 78 activities from 30+ operators across 11 regions - with real suitability info, local knowledge, and the practical details that help you pick the right adventure, not just the prettiest one.

## Our Story

This started because we kept watching families turn up at the wrong Snowdon path, couples book coasteering when one of them can't swim, and groups drive two hours to find an activity was fully booked. Wales has incredible outdoor adventures, but the information out there is either generic tourism copy or scattered across dozens of operator websites.

We spent months talking to guides, operators, and locals across Wales. We drove every route, checked every parking situation, and asked the awkward questions - like which activities get cancelled most often, which operators are actually qualified, and where you'll spend half your day stuck in traffic.

## What We Do

### Honest Suitability Info
Every activity tells you who it's for and who should skip it. Specific ages, fitness levels, and fears addressed - not just "suitable for all."

### Local Intelligence
Which side of the mountain gets less rain. Which road to avoid on Friday evenings. Where locals go when tourists clog up the popular spots.

### Verified Operators
Every operator on this site is checked for qualifications, insurance, and track record. We don't list everyone - we list the ones worth booking.

### Trip Planning That Works
Our itineraries are built around real logistics - drive times, booking windows, weather patterns, and backup plans for when it rains (it will rain).

## Our Values

### Honesty Over Hype
If something isn't worth the money, we'll say so. If the weather usually ruins it in November, we'll tell you. No hidden agendas, no pay-for-placement.

### Respect the Land
Wales is small and precious. We promote operators who look after it and practices that keep it wild for the next lot.

### Support Welsh Businesses
Every operator on this site is Welsh-based. Your money stays in local communities, supporting the people who make these adventures possible.

### Safety Without Patronising
We give you the real risks, not watered-down disclaimers. You're adults making decisions - we give you the information to make good ones.
