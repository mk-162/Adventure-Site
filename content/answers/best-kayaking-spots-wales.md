# Where are the best Kayaking locations in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Wales offers incredible kayaking for all levels. For sea kayaking, head to Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, with its stunning cliffs and hidden coves. For river kayaking, the River Wye and River Tryweryn provide exhilarating experiences, with operators like TYF Adventure offering guided tours and equipment hire.

## Sea Kayaking Adventures on the Pembrokeshire Coast

The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park is a sea kayaker's paradise, boasting dramatic cliffs, secluded beaches, and abundant wildlife. Launch from Stackpole Quay and explore the iconic Stack Rocks and the Green Bridge of Wales, keeping an eye out for seals and seabirds. A half-day guided sea kayaking tour with Celtic Quest Coasteering from Porthclais Harbour will cost around £50-£60 per person and is suitable for beginners. For more experienced paddlers, a multi-day expedition along the coast offers the chance to discover hidden gems like Skomer Island, famous for its puffin colony (best viewed in spring and early summer). Be aware that the Pembrokeshire coast can be exposed, and conditions can change rapidly, so check the forecast and consider going with a guide, especially if you're new to sea kayaking.

## River Kayaking on the Wye and Tryweryn

For river kayaking, the River Wye offers a gentler, more scenic experience, perfect for families and those new to the sport. Hire a kayak from Wye Valley Canoes in Glasbury-on-Wye and paddle downstream, enjoying the lush countryside and abundant wildlife. A day's hire for a single kayak will cost around £35-£40. In contrast, the River Tryweryn, near Bala, is a purpose-built white-water course offering a more adrenaline-fueled experience. The National White Water Centre offers coached sessions and open sessions for experienced kayakers. Prices start from around £45 for a 2-hour session. The Tryweryn is dam-controlled, so check the release schedule before you go.

## Practical Tips

- Check the tide times before you go sea kayaking, as some areas are only accessible at certain states of the tide.
- The water around Wales can be cold, even in summer, so wear appropriate clothing, such as a wetsuit or drysuit. Consider companies like Lomo Watersports for affordable gear.
- Book your kayaking trip in advance, especially during peak season (July and August), to avoid disappointment.
- Parking at popular kayaking spots like Stackpole Quay can be limited, so arrive early or consider using public transport.
