# What are the Best Photography Spots in Snowdonia?

## Quick Answer

Snowdonia National Park is a photographer's dream, offering dramatic mountainscapes, serene lakes, and rugged coastlines. Some of the best spots include the summit of Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), Llyn Ogwen with Tryfan as a backdrop, and the coastal views from Dinas Dinlle. Don't forget the unique landscapes found in and around the slate quarries, which offer a different, more industrial, beauty.

## Iconic Snowdonia Locations

Snowdonia is famous for its majestic scenery, and these locations consistently deliver stunning photographs:

*   **Snowdon Summit (Yr Wyddfa):** The highest peak in Wales provides panoramic views stretching as far as Ireland on a clear day. Sunrise and sunset are particularly rewarding but require careful planning and potentially an overnight stay. Several routes lead to the summit, including the Llanberis Path for a gentler ascent, or Crib Goch for experienced hikers seeking a dramatic ridge walk. MountainXperience and Snowdonia Mountain Guides offer guided Snowdon Walks for various fitness levels.

*   **Llyn Ogwen:** This lake, nestled at the foot of Tryfan and the Glyderau mountains, offers incredible reflections and a classic Snowdonia vista. It's easily accessible from the A5, making it a convenient stop. Consider capturing images during different weather conditions – mist and low clouds can add a sense of mystery.

*   **Tryfan:** Even if you don't want to scramble to the top, this iconic mountain is striking from every angle. Excellent photo opportunities are available from the shores of Llyn Ogwen, the Ogwen Valley, and while hiking nearby peaks.

*   **Dinas Dinlle:** Situated on the coast, this Iron Age hillfort offers stunning views of the Llyn Peninsula and Anglesey. It’s a particularly good spot for sunset photography and capturing the dramatic coastline.

*   **The Slate Quarries (Dinorwic, Penrhyn):** The remnants of the slate industry offer a unique and often overlooked photographic subject. The stark, industrial landscape contrasts beautifully with the surrounding mountains. Be mindful of safety when exploring these areas.
