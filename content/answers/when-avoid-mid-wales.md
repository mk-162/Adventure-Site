# When should I avoid visiting Mid Wales?

## Quick Answer

Avoid Mid Wales during the Royal Welsh Show week in late July. Accommodation prices skyrocket in Builth Wells and surrounding areas, and roads become extremely congested. Also, be wary of visiting during major cycling or rally events like the Cambrian Rally, as certain routes and trails may be closed or heavily trafficked.

## Avoiding the Crowds and Chaos

While Mid Wales offers year-round adventure, some periods are best avoided if you prefer a quieter experience. The Royal Welsh Show, held annually in Builth Wells, is a massive event that draws huge crowds. Finding accommodation within a reasonable distance becomes a challenge, and prices can easily double or triple. Expect heavy traffic on the A470 and surrounding roads, making travel slow and frustrating.

Another time to consider avoiding certain areas is during major motorsport events. The Cambrian Rally, for example, often uses forest roads around Llandrindod Wells and Newtown, leading to temporary closures and increased traffic. Check local event calendars before planning your trip, especially if you intend to explore remote areas by car or bike. Similarly, large cycling events can impact popular routes like the Elan Valley Trail.

## Seasonal Considerations

| Season | Best For | Potential Drawbacks | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Spring (Apr-May) | Hiking, Mountain Biking | Occasional rain, lambing season (trail diversions) | Brecon Beacons National Park, Elan Valley |
| Summer (Jun-Aug) | Watersports, Camping | Crowds, peak prices | Cardigan Bay, Lake Vyrnwy |
| Autumn (Sep-Oct) | Photography, Hiking | Muddy trails, shorter daylight hours | Dyfi Forest, Hafren Forest |
| Winter (Nov-Mar) | Peace and quiet, stargazing | Cold weather, limited daylight, some attractions closed | Cambrian Mountains, Elan Valley Dark Sky Park |

## Practical Tips

- Book accommodation well in advance, especially if travelling during peak season or major events. Consider staying in smaller villages like Llanidloes or Rhayader for better availability and prices.
- Check Natural Resources Wales (NRW) website for forestry access updates, especially if planning to hike or bike in forested areas. They often post information about closures due to logging or events.
- Be prepared for variable weather, even in summer. Pack layers, waterproofs, and sturdy footwear. The weather in the mountains can change rapidly.
- Consider visiting during the shoulder seasons (April-May or September-October) for fewer crowds and pleasant weather.
