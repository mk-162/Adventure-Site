  "description": "Bryn Celli Ddu ('the mound in the dark grove') is one of Wales' most atmospheric prehistoric sites, and Winter Solstice brings a special gathering to this ancient Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey. While the passage is famously aligned to the Summer Solstice sunrise, the modern-day Anglesey Druid Order has celebrated Winter Solstice here for over 20 years. As daylight fades on the shortest day, participants gather for a ceremony honouring Welsh mythology, the Mabinogi, and the symbolic return of the sun. Offerings are made to the spirits of land, sea, and sky, and the Mari Lwyd - the ghostly horse skull of Welsh tradition - often makes an appearance. It's a profound connection to 5,000 years of human ritual at this sacred site.",
