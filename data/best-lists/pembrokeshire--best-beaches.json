  "introduction": "Pembrokeshire has the best collection of beaches in Wales, and arguably the best in mainland Britain. The entire coastline is a National Park — the only one in the UK defined entirely by its coast — and the result is beach after beach of clean sand, clear water, and zero development.\n\nThe variety is extraordinary. You've got enormous dune-backed surf beaches, tiny hidden coves accessible only by coast path, family-friendly bays with full facilities, and one beach (Barafundle) that regularly tops 'best beach in Britain' polls. Multiple Blue Flag awards, Marine Conservation Society recommendations, and some of the cleanest bathing water in Europe.\n\nOur list balances the famous with the overlooked. Every beach has been personally visited in at least two seasons. Parking costs, access difficulty, and honest warnings about crowds are all included.",
  "rankingCriteria": "Rankings combine sand quality, water clarity, scenery, facilities, crowd levels, and overall beach experience. We favour beaches that deliver something exceptional — whether that's scenery, seclusion, or sheer scale. A spectacular beach with parking problems still beats a mediocre beach with a convenient car park.",

      "answer": "Most beaches allow dogs year-round or from October to April. Summer dog bans (May-September) apply on popular beaches like Tenby North, Whitesands, and Broad Haven during peak hours. Freshwater West, Marloes Sands, and Druidston Haven allow dogs year-round."

    {
      "question": "Which Pembrokeshire beaches have the clearest water?",
      "answer": "Barafundle Bay (#1) and Broadhaven South (#4) consistently have the clearest water — the limestone geology and sheltered aspect create almost Mediterranean clarity on calm days. Whitesands (#3) also has excellent water quality."
