  "description": "Established in 1772—making it one of the very oldest agricultural societies on record—the Vale Show transforms the Penllyn showground into South Wales's largest one-day event every August Wednesday. Over 20,000 visitors from town and countryside converge to celebrate everything that makes the Vale special: from champion livestock and horses to 200+ trade stands showcasing local crafts and produce. It's where farming tradition meets festival atmosphere, where vintage tractors share the spotlight with cutting-edge country pursuits, and where the whole of the Vale comes together for one spectacular day. The show features livestock judging, equestrian events, local produce stalls, and family entertainment, celebrating the agricultural heritage of this fertile farming region between Cardiff and the coast.",
