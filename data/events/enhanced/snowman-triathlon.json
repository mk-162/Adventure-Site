  "description": "Crowned Welsh Triathlon Event of the Year 2021, the Snowman is notorious as the UK's toughest multi-terrain triathlon. Swim in the crystal waters of Llynnau Mymbyr beneath the shadow of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), tackle one of Britain's finest bike courses through Beddgelert, Blaenau Ffestiniog, and the Crimea Pass, then summit Moel Siabod (872m) on foot. The Standard distance alone features 1,200m of climbing on the bike and a mountain summit on the run. Just when you think you're done, another challenge awaits. This is triathlon for those who want more than transitions and flat courses—it's an adrenaline-fuelled adventure through Snowdonia's most spectacular terrain.",
  "who_its_for": "Experienced triathletes seeking the ultimate UK challenge. Sprint distance suits intermediate athletes; Standard and Legend distances demand serious mountain fitness and trail running ability.",
