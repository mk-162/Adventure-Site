  "description": "The 42nd edition of Marathon Eryri is one of Britain's most iconic and challenging road marathons, weaving through the spectacular heart of Snowdonia National Park. Starting in the mountain village of Llanberis, runners climb to Pen y Pass (1,100ft) before descending through Beddgelert and tackling the punishing Bwlch y Groes climb. The route showcases Wales' most dramatic scenery—rugged mountain peaks, ancient slate quarries, and pristine valleys. This isn't a PB course; it's a test of character. With 12 feed stations, legendary crowd support, and a heroes' welcome back in Llanberis, Marathon Eryri delivers an unforgettable experience for runners who want more than a flat, fast race. Perfect for experienced marathoners seeking adventure over speed.",
