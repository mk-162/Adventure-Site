# About Carmarthenshire

Carmarthenshire. This is real Wales. Forget the crowds flocking to Snowdonia, here you'll find a raw, untamed landscape ripe for exploration. Rolling hills give way to dramatic coastline, punctuated by hidden coves and windswept headlands. It's a land of ancient forests, cascading waterfalls, and the broad, fertile Towy Valley.

This region offers a more rugged, authentic experience. Adventure seekers come here to escape the tourist traps, to push their limits, and to discover the wild spirit of Wales, whether that’s hiking the Brecon Beacons' western fringes, paddling the estuaries, or exploring the extensive network of forest trails.

## Best For

- Coastal Hiking: Miles of dramatic coastline offering challenging walks and stunning views.
- Mountain Biking: Forest trails and challenging climbs for all skill levels.
- Wild Swimming: Discover hidden waterfalls and plunge pools for invigorating dips.

## Best Time to Visit

Spring (April-May) and Autumn (September-October) offer the best balance of pleasant weather and fewer crowds. The wildflowers are spectacular in spring, while autumn brings vibrant colours to the hills.

Summer (June-August) is the warmest time, but also the busiest. Be prepared for potentially crowded trails and higher accommodation prices. Winter (November-March) can be harsh, with cold temperatures and unpredictable weather, but the dramatic landscapes are often at their most impressive, offering a unique, solitary experience for the well-prepared. Be aware that some attractions and activities may have limited hours or be closed during the winter months.

## Getting There

The nearest airport is Cardiff Airport (CWL), approximately 1.5-2 hours drive away. Carmarthen is the main train station, with direct links to Swansea, Cardiff and London Paddington. Driving times from major UK cities: London (4-5 hours), Birmingham (3-4 hours), Manchester (4-5 hours).

## Pro Tips

- The tide waits for no one: check tide times before planning any coastal adventures, especially if you're hiking around headlands or exploring caves.
- Download offline maps: Phone signal can be patchy in remote areas, so download maps beforehand. OS Maps is your friend.
- For a truly unforgettable experience, seek out local farms offering wild camping. The views are incredible, and you'll wake up to the sounds of nature.
