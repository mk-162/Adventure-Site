# Best Paintball and Stag Do Activities in Wales?

For a proper stag do with adrenaline, head to [North Wales](/north-wales) or [South Wales](/south-wales) — you'll find paintball, gorge walking, coasteering, and quad biking all within easy reach of decent pubs and accommodation.

## Why Wales for a Stag Do

Wales beats most English stag destinations on three counts: it's cheaper, it's less crowded, and the activities are genuinely better. You're dealing with real mountains, real coastline, and real rivers — not a field next to the M25 with some inflatable obstacles.

The other advantage? Most Welsh adventure centres are used to stag groups. They know the drill, they'll push the competitive angle, and they'll make sure nobody actually gets hurt (well, mostly).

## Top Stag Activities

### Paintball & Combat Games

Several large paintball sites operate across Wales, with purpose-built arenas in woodland settings. Expect to pay £25–£40 per person for a half-day session including equipment and a set number of paintballs. Extra ammo costs more — budget an extra £10–£20 per head for trigger-happy groups.

**Battlezone** near Cardiff and **Campaign Paintball** in [North Wales](/north-wales) are well-established operators with multiple game zones. For something more tactical, look for sites offering laser tag or airsoft — lower pain factor, same competitive edge.

### Gorge Walking

This is the one your group will talk about for years. Scrambling up waterfalls, jumping off rocks into plunge pools, and wading through narrow gorges in the [Brecon Beacons](/brecon-beacons) or [Snowdonia](/snowdonia). It's physical, it's hilarious when your mate slips, and it works brilliantly for groups. Around £45–£65 per person for a half-day guided session. Check out our [gorge walking guide](/activities/gorge-walking) for more.

### Coasteering

[Coasteering](/activities/coasteering) in [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire) is a stag do classic. Cliff jumping, cave swimming, wave riding — all led by a guide who knows the coastline. Operators like TYF and Preseli Venture run group sessions from around £50–£70 per person. The competitive element writes itself: who'll jump off the highest cliff?

### Quad Biking & Off-Road

Several centres offer quad biking through Welsh forestry and farmland. Sessions run from £40–£60 for an hour. Some sites combine quads with clay pigeon shooting or archery for a full day package.

### Multi-Activity Packages

The smart move for a stag do is booking a package. Most Welsh adventure centres offer full-day or weekend deals combining 2–3 activities with group discounts. Expect to pay £80–£150 per person for a full day of two activities, or £200–£300 for a weekend package.
