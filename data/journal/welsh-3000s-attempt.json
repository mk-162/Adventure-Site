Here's how we got on, what went wrong, and whether I'd recommend you even try it.\n\n# The Welsh 3000s in One Day — Our Attempt\n\nThe Welsh 3000s. Just the name sounds daunting, doesn’t it? It's a challenge I'd been itching to try for years: summiting all 15 mountains in Wales over 3,000 feet (914.4 metres) within 24 hours, without using any transport. Sounds simple enough on paper, right? Wrong.\n\n## Why Bother?\n\nOkay, let’s be honest. Bragging rights are a big part of it. But more than that, it's about pushing your limits, experiencing the raw beauty of Snowdonia, and seeing if you can physically and mentally endure a seriously tough challenge. If you’re the type who enjoys a leisurely stroll around Llyn Padarn, sipping coffee in Llanberis afterwards, this probably isn’t for you. This is for people who enjoy pushing into the red, and who are very comfortable with exposure on knife-edge ridges. Maybe you've already bagged Snowdon via the Llanberis Path with Snowdonia Mountain Guides and want to take it to the next level?\n\n## The Route\n\nThe classic route starts in the north and moves south. We opted for this as well, as the descent from Snowdon is far easier on the legs at the end.\n\n1.  **Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa):** Starting point, usually via the Watkins Path or Crib Goch (if you're feeling spicy – maybe book a guided Crib Goch scramble with MountainXperience beforehand).\n2.  **Garnedd Ugain:** A relatively easy hop from Snowdon.\n3.  **Crib Goch:** The notorious knife-edge ridge. Skip this if you hate heights, seriously. One wrong step and you're in trouble.\n4.  **Crib y Ddysgl (also known as Garnedd Llewelyn):** Another summit, but often bypassed due to its proximity to Crib Goch.\n5.  **Elidir Fawr:** The start of the Glyderau range. This is a long slog.\n6.  **Mynydd Perfedd:** Often overlooked as it's a minor top of Elidir Fawr.\n7.  **Y Garn:** A steep climb from the valley floor.\n8.  **Glyder Fawr:** Famous for its Cantilever Stone, a prime photo opportunity.\n9.  **Glyder Fach:** Home to the iconic Castell y Gwynt (the Castle of the Wind), a cluster of jagged rocks.\n10. **Tryfan:** A scrambler's paradise. North Ridge is the classic route, but not for the faint of heart.\n11. **Bristly Ridge:** Another exposed scramble, leading to...\n12. **Glyder Fach (again!):** Yes, you have to go over it twice.\n13. **Pen yr Ole Wen:** The start of the Carneddau range.\n14. **Carnedd Dafydd:** A relatively easy summit.\n15. **Carnedd Llewelyn:** The final summit!\n\n## Preparation is Key\n\nDon’t even think about attempting this without proper planning.\n\n*   **Fitness:** You need to be mountain fit. Regular hiking with significant elevation gain is essential. Trail running is also a good addition to your training, especially in places like Coed y Brenin.\n*   **Navigation:** Map and compass skills are non-negotiable. GPS is helpful, but don't rely solely on technology. Familiarise yourself with the route beforehand. The OS Explorer OL17 map is your friend.\n*   **Gear:** Good hiking boots, waterproofs, layers, a headtorch (with spare batteries), and a decent rucksack are essential. I used my trusty OMM Classic 32.\n*   **Food and Water:** You'll need to carry enough calories and fluids to last you the entire day. I packed energy gels, cereal bars, sandwiches, and at least 3 litres of water. Consider a hydration bladder for easy access.\n*   **Weather:** Check the forecast religiously. This is Snowdonia; the weather can change in an instant. Be prepared for the worst. MWIS (Mountain Weather Information Service) is your go-to.\n\n## Our Attempt – The Good, The Bad, and The Blisters\n\nWe set off from Nant Peris at 4:00 AM. Parking there is £6 for the day, payable by card or app. The initial climb up the Watkins Path was tough, but we made good time. Reaching the summit of Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) as the sun began to rise was spectacular.\n\nThe ridge leading to Garnedd Ugain and Crib Goch was exhilarating. Crib Goch is always a nervy experience; the wind was picking up, making the scramble even more precarious. If this sounds like your idea of hell, perhaps try something different, like some underground adventures at Zip World Llechwedd.\n\nThings started to unravel on Elidir Fawr. The endless ascent took its toll, and my pace slowed considerably. Blisters began to form, and my energy levels plummeted. By the time we reached Y Garn, I was seriously questioning my sanity.\n\nThe Glyderau were brutal. Tryfan's North Ridge was a welcome distraction, a challenging scramble that momentarily took my mind off the pain. Bristly Ridge was equally taxing, and the second ascent of Glyder Fach felt like torture.\n\nAt this point, we were well behind schedule. We made the difficult decision to bail after descending from Tryfan, rather than risk injury or getting caught out in the dark. We limped down to Ogwen Cottage, called a taxi (£25 to take us back to Nant Peris), and headed straight for the nearest pub.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n*   **Pace Yourself:** It's a marathon, not a sprint. Don't go out too hard at the beginning.\n*   **Blister Prevention:** Address hotspots immediately. I neglected mine and paid the price.\n*   **Nutrition is Key:** Keep eating and drinking throughout the day, even when you don't feel like it.\n*   **Mental Toughness:** This is as much a mental challenge as it is a physical one. Be prepared to dig deep.\n*   **Know When to Quit:** It's better to bail and live to fight another day than to push yourself beyond your limits and risk serious injury.\n\n## Would I Recommend It?\n\nThat’s a tough one. If you’re an experienced mountain walker with a high level of fitness and a masochistic streak, then go for it. But be prepared for a seriously tough day out.\n\nFor most people, I’d suggest tackling the Welsh 3000s over two or three days. It's a much more enjoyable experience, allowing you to savour the scenery and avoid the worst of the suffering.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for a less extreme Snowdonia adventure, consider exploring some of the area's stunning lakes by kayak, perhaps on a sea kayaking trip with Plas y Brenin. Or maybe you fancy hurling yourself down a zip line at Zip World Velocity 2 instead?\n\n## Costs\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we spent (prices accurate for 2025/2026 season):\n\n*   **Parking:** £6 (Nant Peris)\n*   **Taxi:** £25 (Ogwen Cottage to Nant Peris)\n*   **Food and Drink:** £20 (estimate – I already had most of the gear)\n*   **Total:** £51\n\nNot a fortune, but a reminder that even \"free\" activities have associated costs.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nDespite failing to complete the challenge, I don't regret attempting the Welsh 3000s. It was a valuable learning experience, a brutal reminder of the power of the mountains. Will I try again? Maybe. But next time, I'll be better prepared, and I'll definitely invest in some better blister plasters.",
