# How fit do I need to be for Coasteering in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Coasteering in Wales requires a reasonable level of fitness. You should be comfortable swimming in open water, able to scramble over rocks, and have the agility to handle uneven terrain. While you don't need to be an elite athlete, a basic level of cardiovascular fitness and upper body strength will definitely enhance your experience and safety.

## Assessing Your Coasteering Fitness

Coasteering involves a mix of swimming, traversing rocky coastlines, and (optional) cliff jumping, so it's more demanding than a casual beach stroll. Operators like TYF Adventure in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, offer different coasteering routes graded by difficulty. A beginner route might involve shorter swims and lower jumps, while advanced routes demand strong swimming skills and confidence with heights. Expect to be in the water for a significant portion of the session, battling currents and waves. If you regularly engage in activities like hiking, swimming, or climbing, you'll likely find coasteering manageable. If you're unsure, consider starting with a shorter, less challenging route. Prices generally range from £50-£80 per person, depending on the location and duration.

Consider the time of year too. Coasteering in the summer months (June-August) generally provides calmer waters and warmer temperatures, making it physically less demanding than braving the waves in spring or autumn. Remember that even in summer, the sea can be unpredictable!

## Coasteering Options and Fitness Levels

Here's a breakdown of coasteering options and their suitability based on fitness:

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Pembrokeshire Coast Path Coasteer | Beginners & Families | Moderate | St. Davids, Pembrokeshire |
| Anglesey Coasteering | Adventurous Individuals | Challenging | Anglesey |
| Gower Peninsula Coasteering | Experienced Swimmers | Moderate to Hard | Gower Peninsula |

## Practical Tips

- Check the tide times before you book. Coasteering is often best around low tide for easier access to the coastline.
- Wear appropriate footwear. Old trainers or wetsuit boots with good grip are essential. Don't even think about flip-flops!
- Ask your operator about the specific route and challenges involved. Don't be afraid to be honest about your fitness level.
- Be prepared for cold water, even in summer. A good quality wetsuit is crucial for staying comfortable and safe.
