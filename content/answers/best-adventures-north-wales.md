# What are the best adventure activities in North Wales?

## Quick Answer

North Wales is an adventure playground! For adrenaline junkies, try Zip World's Velocity 2, the fastest zip line in the world, or tackle the Via Ferrata at Go Below. If you prefer water, head to Anglesey for coasteering with B активті, or try canyoning in Eryri (Snowdonia) with experienced local guides from Gaia Adventures.

## Conquer the Heights: Zip Lines, Climbing, and Scrambling

North Wales is renowned for its mountainous terrain, offering a plethora of activities for those who love heights. Zip World reigns supreme, with multiple locations and experiences. Velocity 2 at Penrhyn Quarry is a must for thrill-seekers, reaching speeds of over 100 mph (prices from £89). For something less intense but equally rewarding, try Bounce Below, an underground net adventure in a slate cavern (from £32).

For climbers, Eryri National Park (Snowdonia) offers everything from beginner-friendly crags to challenging multi-pitch routes. The Llanberis Pass is a classic climbing destination, with routes suitable for all abilities. If scrambling is more your style, try Crib Goch on Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), but be warned – it's not for the faint-hearted and requires a good head for heights and suitable weather conditions. Always check weather forecasts and consider hiring a local mountain guide, especially if you're new to the area. A day's guided climbing or scrambling typically costs between £150-£250 per person.

## Make a Splash: Coasteering, Canyoning, and White Water

The rugged coastline of North Wales and the fast-flowing rivers of Eryri create ideal conditions for water-based adventures. Anglesey is a coasteering hotspot, with numerous companies like B активті offering guided tours along the dramatic cliffs. Expect to swim, climb, and jump into the sea (prices from £50). Canyoning in Eryri is another exhilarating experience, involving rappelling down waterfalls and navigating through narrow gorges. Gaia Adventures and other local providers offer canyoning trips suitable for different skill levels.

For white water enthusiasts, the National White Water Centre near Bala provides artificial rapids for kayaking and rafting. A guided rafting session costs around £60 per person. Alternatively, Llyn Tegid (Bala Lake) is perfect for kayaking, paddleboarding, and sailing. Several watersports centres around the lake offer equipment rental and tuition. Be aware that the sea and rivers in Wales can be cold, even in summer, so appropriate wetsuits and safety gear are essential.

## Practical Tips

- Check the weather forecast before you go! Mountain weather in Eryri can change rapidly, so be prepared for all conditions. Websites like the Met Office provide detailed forecasts.
- Book activities in advance, especially during peak season (summer and school holidays). Popular attractions like Zip World often sell out weeks in advance.
- Parking in Eryri can be limited, particularly at popular trailheads. Arrive early or consider using the Sherpa bus service, which connects many of the main walking routes.
- Wear appropriate footwear. Sturdy hiking boots are essential for most mountain activities. For water-based activities, wetsuits and closed-toe shoes are recommended.
