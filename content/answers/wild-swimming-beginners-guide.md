# What are the best Wild Swimming tips for beginners?

## Quick Answer

Wild swimming in Wales is incredible, but start safe! Always check water conditions and tides, especially on the Gower Peninsula. Begin with supervised swims with operators like TYF Adventure in Pembrokeshire, and never swim alone.

## Gearing Up and Getting Started

Before diving into the refreshing waters of Wales, a little preparation goes a long way. Firstly, invest in a good quality wetsuit – even in summer, the Welsh waters can be chilly! Expect to pay around £80-£150 for a decent entry-level suit from a local surf shop in Llangennith. Secondly, consider brightly coloured swim caps and tow floats to increase your visibility to other water users. Operators like Celtic Quest Coasteering in St Davids also offer guided wild swimming sessions, including gear, for around £45 per person, which is a great way to start.

Beyond gear, location matters. Avoid fast-flowing rivers initially; opt instead for calmer lakes like Llyn Padarn in Eryri (Snowdonia) or sheltered sea spots like Aberporth beach in Ceredigion. Always check the tide times if you're swimming in the sea. Also, be aware of potential hazards such as submerged rocks or strong currents; local knowledge is invaluable here.

## Choosing the Right Location

Wales offers diverse wild swimming spots, but some are better suited for beginners than others:

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Llyn Ogwen | Mountain scenery | Easy | Eryri (Snowdonia) |
| Barafundle Bay | Sheltered sea swimming | Easy | Pembrokeshire |
| Blue Lagoon, Abereiddy | Unique quarry swim | Medium (entry/exit) | Pembrokeshire |

## Practical Tips

- Acclimatise to the cold water gradually; don't just jump straight in! Wade in slowly and splash water on your face and neck to help your body adjust.
- Check water quality reports before you swim, especially after heavy rainfall. Natural Resources Wales publishes data online.
- Always tell someone where you're going and when you expect to be back.
- Be aware of the potential for Weil's disease (Leptospirosis) and cover any cuts or grazes with waterproof plasters.
