This guide breaks down the best winter activities in Wales, from underground adventures to mountain hikes, and what to expect in terms of weather, crowds, and cost.\n\n# What's Open in Winter: Wales Activity Calendar\n\nRight, let's be straight. Winter in Wales isn't exactly beach weather. Unless you're a penguin. We get rain. A lot of rain. And wind. And sometimes, if we're lucky, snow. But that doesn't mean you should write it off completely. The crowds are gone, prices are sometimes lower, and the landscape takes on a dramatic, moody beauty that you just don't get in summer.\n\nBut you need to be *realistic*. This isn't the time for delicate watersports. Think sturdy, weatherproof, and prepared for a bit of a battering.\n\n## Snowdonia: Mountain Highs and Underground Lows\n\nSnowdonia in winter is a different beast. The mountains are often capped with snow, and the trails can be icy and treacherous. But if you're prepared, it's incredible.\n\n### Mountain Walking and Scrambling\n\nForget about a casual stroll up Snowdon in January. Unless you're experienced and properly equipped (winter boots, crampons, ice axe, the whole shebang), stick to lower-level walks. Even the Llanberis Path can be tricky with ice. Consider a guided walk with Snowdonia Mountain Guides for around £60-80 – they know the mountain inside and out, and they'll keep you safe. MountainXperience also offers guided walks on the Llanberis Path (£45-65) and for experienced hikers, guided Crib Goch scrambles (£55-75), but check availability, as these are weather-dependent.\n\n**Who should do it:** Experienced hikers with proper winter gear and navigation skills. Or, book a guided tour.\n**Who should skip it:** Fair-weather walkers and those with no experience in winter conditions.\n\n### Adrenaline Rush: Zip Lines and Forest Coasters\n\nFor something a bit less…serious, Zip World is mostly open year-round. Velocity 2, the fastest zip line in the world, is still running (pricey at £89-109, mind you, but a hell of a rush). It's weather dependent, so check before you go. The Zip World Fforest Coaster is a fun option too, and a bit easier on the wallet at £25-35.\n\n**Who should do it:** Adrenaline junkies who don't mind the cold.\n**Who should skip it:** Those who hate heights or have a weak stomach.\n\n### Go Underground\n\nFor a truly unique winter experience, head underground. Bounce Below, also at Zip World, offers trampoline fun in a massive cavern (around £25-35). Alternatively, try the Underground Adventure at Zip World Llechwedd (£20-35). It's a guided tour through a Victorian slate mine. These are both generally less affected by the weather above ground.\n\n**Who should do it:** Families looking for a fun and unique activity.\n**Who should skip it:** Those who are claustrophobic.\n\n### Mountain Biking\n\nCoed y Brenin Forest Park is open year-round for mountain biking. The MinorTaur trail is a good option for families and less experienced riders. For something more challenging, try the Temtiwr trail, but be aware that conditions can be slippery in winter. Parking is £2-7. Antur Stiniog, the downhill mountain biking park, is also open some winter weekends, weather permitting. Uplift passes are around £35-45. Check their website for opening times.\n\n**Who should do it:** Mountain bikers with appropriate tyres and gear for wet and muddy conditions.\n**Who should skip it:** Road cyclists and those without off-road experience.\n\n## Pembrokeshire: Coastal Adventures (If You're Brave Enough)\n\nPembrokeshire is stunning in winter, but the sea is *cold*. Very cold.\n\n### Coasteering\n\nCoasteering is still an option, but you'll need a good wetsuit and a healthy dose of bravery. TYF Adventure and Preseli Venture both offer coasteering trips year-round (or as near as the weather allows). Expect to pay around £60 for a trip with TYF. Preseli Venture also offers kayaking and surfing opportunities, but they are not for the faint of heart.\n\n**Who should do it:** Those who don't mind the cold and are looking for a unique coastal experience.\n**Who should skip it:** Anyone who feels the cold easily or is afraid of the sea.\n\n### Coastal Walks\n\nEven if you don't fancy getting in the water, the Pembrokeshire Coast Path is worth exploring in winter. Just wrap up warm and be prepared for wind and rain. Highlights include the stretch from Tenby to Saundersfoot, or the rugged coastline around St. David's. Parking can be limited in some areas, especially around popular spots like Barafundle Bay.\n\n**Who should do it:** Anyone who enjoys coastal scenery and doesn't mind a bit of wind and rain.\n**Who should skip it:** Those who prefer fair-weather walking.\n\n## Brecon Beacons: Caves and Waterfalls\n\nThe Brecon Beacons can be just as challenging as Snowdonia in winter, but there are some good options for those who are prepared.\n\n### Caving and Gorge Walking\n\nAdventure Britain offers caving and gorge walking trips in the Brecon Beacons year-round. These are great options for exploring the area in all weather conditions. Expect to pay around £65-95 for a gorge walking trip. Caving is a good alternative when surface conditions are truly awful.\n\n**Who should do it:** Adventurous types who don't mind getting wet and muddy.\n**Who should skip it:** Those who are claustrophobic or have mobility issues.\n\n## General Winter Survival Tips\n\n*   **Check the weather forecast:** This should be obvious, but it's even more important in winter. Be prepared for sudden changes in conditions. Mountain Weather Information Service (MWIS) is your friend.\n*   **Dress in layers:** This allows you to adjust your clothing to the changing conditions.\n*   **Wear waterproofs:** A good waterproof jacket and trousers are essential.\n*   **Wear sturdy footwear:** Walking boots with good grip are a must.\n*   **Take a map and compass:** Don't rely on your phone for navigation, as batteries can die quickly in the cold. And learn how to use them, mind.\n*   **Tell someone where you're going:** And when you expect to be back.\n*   **Be prepared to turn back:** There's no shame in admitting defeat if the conditions are too challenging.\n\n## Is it Worth it?\n\nHonestly? It depends. If you're looking for guaranteed sunshine and warm weather, then Wales in winter isn't for you. But if you're prepared to embrace the elements, you'll be rewarded with stunning scenery, fewer crowds, and a sense of adventure that you just don't get in summer. Just remember to pack your waterproofs and your sense of humour.\n\nAnd if you're still not convinced, consider a winter break in the Wye Valley, where the lower altitude means milder weather and plenty of woodland walks, or exploring the historic castles along the North Wales Coast. You could also look at some of the indoor climbing centres around South Wales Valleys for a less weather-dependent activity.",
