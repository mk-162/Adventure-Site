# What Should I Expect on My First Caving Experience?

## Quick Answer

Expect to get absolutely filthy, be challenged physically and mentally, and come out buzzing. You'll crawl through tight passages, wade through underground rivers, and see a world most people never experience. Operators like Go Below in Conwy and various Brecon Beacons providers offer guided trips starting from around £69 per person — they provide all the specialist kit.

## What to Expect Underground

Caving in Wales is a proper adventure. Here's the honest truth about what your first time will involve:

*   **It's dark.** Properly dark. When your guide turns off all the headlamps for a "darkness experience" (they all do this), you'll see absolutely nothing. It's disorientating and oddly peaceful.
*   **It's tight.** Even beginner caves involve sections where you're on your hands and knees, or squeezing sideways through gaps. If the thought of that makes you panic, be honest with yourself — there's no shame in choosing a more spacious cave system.
*   **It's wet.** Most Welsh caves have water running through them. You'll wade through underground streams and possibly crawl through shallow water. The Brecon Beacons caves are particularly wet.
*   **It's cold.** Underground temperatures sit around 10°C year-round. With wet conditions, that feels colder. Thermal layers under your oversuit make a massive difference.
*   **It's physically demanding.** Even "beginner" trips involve climbing, crawling, and manoeuvring through awkward spaces. You'll use muscles you forgot you had. Expect to be tired (and possibly sore) afterwards.

## Choosing the Right Experience

| Experience | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| Go Below Underground Adventures | Thrill-seekers wanting zip lines, boats, and via ferrata underground | Moderate-Strenuous | Conwy, North Wales |
| Dan yr Ogof Showcaves | Families and those who want to see caves without proper caving | Easy (walking tour) | Brecon Beacons |
| Guided trips with Black Mountain Activities | Groups and beginners wanting real caving | Moderate | Brecon Beacons |
| Porth yr Ogof (self-guided entrance) | A quick taster — walk into the largest cave entrance in Wales | Easy | Ystradfellte, Brecon Beacons |
| OFD (Ogof Ffynnon Ddu) trips via SWCC | Experienced cavers wanting a serious system | Advanced | Brecon Beacons |

The **Brecon Beacons** is the caving heartland of Wales. The limestone landscape is riddled with cave systems — from family-friendly showcaves to the UK's deepest system. [Find caving in the Brecon Beacons](/brecon-beacons/things-to-do/caving).

**Go Below** in North Wales offers something different — abandoned slate mines repurposed as adventure courses with underground zip lines, boat crossings, and rope bridges. It's more "underground adventure" than traditional caving, but it's brilliant fun.

## What to Wear and Bring

*   **Old clothes you don't mind ruining.** Seriously — mud gets everywhere. Thermal base layers (synthetic, not cotton) under whatever the operator provides.
*   **Sturdy boots.** Operators often provide wellies, but check. Your own walking boots with good ankle support work if they don't mind getting wrecked.
*   **A spare set of clothes and a towel** for afterwards. You will desperately want them. Leave them in the car.
*   **Headlamp** — usually provided by the operator, but bring your own as backup if you have one.
*   **Nothing valuable.** Leave your phone, watch, and jewellery in the car. Caves destroy things.

## Practical Tips

*   **Book in advance.** Popular operators like Go Below fill up weeks ahead in summer. Brecon Beacons trips are quieter midweek.
*   **Check the weather.** Not because you'll be outside — because heavy rainfall raises water levels in caves. Operators will cancel if conditions are unsafe. Give it 24-48 hours after heavy rain.
*   **Be honest about fitness and claustrophobia.** A good operator will match you to the right trip. If you're nervous about tight spaces, say so — there are more spacious cave systems available.
*   **Eat before you go.** Caving burns serious energy. Have a decent meal and bring snacks for after.
*   **Caving is year-round.** Unlike most outdoor activities, caves maintain a constant temperature. Winter caving is a brilliant alternative when the mountains are too hostile. It's actually one of the best wet-weather activities in Wales.
