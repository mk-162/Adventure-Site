# Fishing in Wales

Wales punches well above its weight for fishing. With over 1,000 fishing locations, legendary rivers like the Wye and Dee, and a dramatic coastline offering everything from shore casting to deep-sea charters, it's one of the best angling destinations in Britain. And unlike the south of England, you won't be elbow-to-elbow on the bank.

The official Fishing in Wales website (fishingwales.net) maps the lot — but here's the practical guide to actually getting started.

## Types of Fishing

### Fly Fishing (Game)
The headline act. Welsh rivers are famous for:
- **Salmon** — River Wye (one of the UK's premier salmon rivers), River Dee, River Usk, River Teifi. The Wye has been drawing salmon anglers for centuries and still delivers.
- **Sea trout (sewin)** — Wales is the spiritual home of sewin fishing. The Teifi, Towy and Ogmore are legendary. Night fishing for sewin on a warm summer's evening, with bats overhead and the river whispering past — that's a uniquely Welsh experience you don't forget.
- **Brown trout** — Wild brown trout in mountain streams across Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and Mid Wales. The upper Severn near Caersws is excellent. Many of these streams are free to fish with just a rod licence.
- **Grayling** — The Dee is nationally famous for grayling, with prolific numbers and fish regularly exceeding 2lb. Winter grayling fishing when the trees are bare and there's frost on the bank is brilliant.

Season: March–October for most game species. Grayling fishing runs into winter and is arguably at its best in the colder months.

### Sea Angling
Wales has 870 miles of coastline, much of it excellent for fishing:
- **Shore fishing** — Bass, pollack, wrasse, flounder from rocks and beaches. Pembrokeshire and the Llŷn Peninsula are standout spots.
- **Charter boats** — Deep-sea trips for bass, pollack, tope, bream, bull huss. Boats run from Pembrokeshire, Anglesey and the Llŷn coast. Skippers provide all tackle.
- **No licence needed** for sea fishing (unlike freshwater). Just turn up and fish.

### Coarse Fishing
Less famous than the game fishing but still excellent:
- River Taff in Cardiff, River Dee, River Severn all hold quality coarse species.
- Pike, barbel, perch, carp available at various stillwaters and rivers across Wales.

## Where to Fish

### Wye Valley (Best for Salmon)
The River Wye is iconic — arguably the most famous salmon river in England and Wales. Day permits available through local angling associations. The stretches around Builth Wells and Hay-on-Wye are particularly good, with classic fly water and stunning valley scenery. Also excellent for grayling and brown trout.

### Mid Wales / Ceredigion (Best for Sea Trout)
The River Teifi is Wales's premier sea trout river. Notable catches include sewin to 17lb and salmon to 23lb. Llandysul Angling Association offers day, week and season permits on around 30 miles of the Teifi — some of the best-value fishing in Wales. [Explore Mid Wales](/mid-wales)

### Pembrokeshire (Best for Sea Angling)
Charter boats from Milford Haven and the south coast target everything from bass to tope. Shore fishing from the rocks at St David's Head, Strumble Head, and around the Castlemartin coast produces wrasse, pollack and bass. The scenery while you're fishing isn't bad either.

### Snowdonia & North Wales (Best for Wild Trout)
Mountain llyns (lakes) hold wild brown trout in jaw-dropping settings. Many are free to fish with the right rod licence — just you, a rod, and a mountain lake. Rivers like the Glaslyn, Mawddach and Conwy offer variety from gentle lowland pools to tumbling mountain runs. The Dee at Llangollen is a grayling hotspot. [Explore Snowdonia](/snowdonia)

## Top Recommendations

1. **River Teifi sewin fishing** — Night fishing for sea trout on the Teifi between June and August. The quintessential Welsh angling experience. Day permits from ~£15.
2. **River Dee grayling** — Winter grayling fishing on the Dee near Llangollen. Prolific fish, beautiful setting, and the river mostly to yourself.
3. **Pembrokeshire charter boat** — A half-day trip from Milford Haven targeting bass and pollack around the islands. No experience needed, all tackle provided. From ~£40 per person.
4. **Mountain llyn wild trout** — Pick a Snowdonia llyn, pack a rod, and spend the day. Free with a rod licence. Pure fishing.
5. **River Wye salmon** — Spring and autumn salmon on the Wye near Builth Wells. Classic fly water, historic beats, proper angling.

## Cost Guide

- **Rod licence (freshwater)**: ~£30/year for trout and coarse, ~£82 for salmon/sea trout. Buy online from the Environment Agency.
- **Day permits**: Typically £5–20 from local angling associations. Check fishingwales.net for specifics.
- **Guided days**: £100–250 per day depending on species and guide. Worth it if you're new to Welsh waters — they know which pools fish in which conditions.
- **Charter boats**: £35–60 per person for a half-day, £60–100 for a full day. All tackle usually included.
- **Sea fishing**: Free — no licence, no permits needed.

## Safety Considerations

Fishing in Wales is generally low-risk, but rivers deserve respect:
- **Wading**: Welsh rivers can rise fast after rain. Check the forecast, wear proper wading boots with studs, and use a wading staff in faster water. Never wade above your waist.
- **Sea fishing**: Check tide times religiously. Rock fishing at high tide is how people get into serious trouble. Wear a buoyancy aid when shore fishing from rocks.
- **Rod licence**: Fishing without one is illegal and bailiffs do check, particularly on popular rivers. £30 saves you a £2,500 fine.

## Best Time to Visit

- **Spring (March–May)**: Rivers coming into form, brown trout active. Early salmon runs on the Wye. Everything feels fresh.
- **Summer (June–August)**: Prime sewin time on the Teifi and Towy. Night fishing at its best. Sea angling in full swing.
- **Autumn (September–October)**: Salmon running hard. Arguably the most exciting time for game fishing. Autumn colours on the riverbanks are a bonus.
- **Winter (November–February)**: Grayling season on the Dee. Shore fishing for cod, whiting and dogfish. Many rivers closed for game fishing but the winter species more than compensate.

## Who It's For

Fishing in Wales spans the full spectrum. Families can try a stocked trout lake for a guaranteed catch and delighted kids. Serious anglers travel from across Europe for the Wye salmon or Teifi sewin. Sea fishing off Pembrokeshire needs no prior experience — the charter skippers do the hard work. Solo anglers will find genuine solitude on a mountain llyn or quiet Mid Wales river. And couples? A guided fishing day on the Usk or Dee, followed by dinner at a riverside pub — it's more romantic than you'd think.
