# What is the best time of year for Kayaking in Wales?

## Quick Answer

The best time for kayaking in Wales is generally between May and September, offering the most favorable weather conditions and longer daylight hours. For sea kayaking, aim for calmer seas during the summer months. River kayaking is great in spring and autumn when water levels are higher, but always check conditions before you go.

## Prime Paddling Season

Wales boasts diverse kayaking opportunities, from serene coastal paddles to exhilarating river runs. During May to September, the weather is typically warmer and drier, making it ideal for sea kayaking along the Pembrokeshire coast. Operators like TYF Adventure in St Davids offer guided sea kayaking tours from £65 per person, exploring stunning spots like St Justinian's and Ramsey Island. For river kayaking, the River Wye is popular, with guided trips available from providers like Wye Valley Canoes, costing around £40-£60 for a half-day rental. Be aware that coastal waters can still be chilly, even in summer, so appropriate gear is essential.

The shoulder seasons (April and October) can also be rewarding, with fewer crowds and stunning autumn colors along the rivers. However, be prepared for more unpredictable weather and potentially rougher sea conditions. Always check the forecast and consider your experience level before heading out.

## Practical Tips

- Always check the tide times and weather forecast before heading out, especially for sea kayaking. Websites like the Met Office provide detailed marine forecasts.
- Consider joining a guided tour, especially if you are new to kayaking or unfamiliar with the area. Local guides know the best spots and can provide valuable safety advice.
- Parking at popular kayaking spots like Stackpole Quay in Pembrokeshire can be limited, especially during peak season. Arrive early or consider using public transport.
- Wear appropriate clothing for the conditions, including a wetsuit or drysuit, a buoyancy aid, and waterproof layers. Even on warm days, the water can be cold.
