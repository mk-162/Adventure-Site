# How Fit Do I Need to Be for Coasteering in Wales?

## Quick Answer

You need to be a competent swimmer and have a reasonable level of general fitness. You don't need to be an athlete — most people who can swim 50 metres unaided, walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded, and don't mind getting cold and wet will manage a standard coasteering session. The wetsuit and buoyancy aid do a lot of the work. Be honest with yourself and with the operator about your level.

## The Detail

### What the Activity Actually Demands

Coasteering involves:
*   **Swimming in open water** — often against light currents, in choppy conditions, and in cold water. This is the biggest fitness factor. If you're a confident pool swimmer but have never swum in the sea, expect it to feel significantly harder. The wetsuit and buoyancy aid help, but you still need to propel yourself.
*   **Scrambling over rocks** — using hands and feet to traverse uneven, slippery surfaces. Requires balance, coordination, and a bit of upper body strength to pull yourself up and over obstacles.
*   **Climbing short sections** — not rock climbing, but occasionally hauling yourself up a metre or two of rock face. Good grip strength helps.
*   **Jumping (optional)** — the cliff jumps are always optional, but entering and exiting the water from rocky platforms isn't. You need to be able to lower yourself into water and climb out.
*   **Sustaining effort for 2-3 hours** — a typical session lasts 2-3 hours with short rests. That's 2-3 hours of intermittent swimming, scrambling, and walking in a wetsuit. It's more tiring than you'd expect.

### Fitness Levels and What to Expect

**"I exercise once a week or less":** A standard beginner session will be manageable but tiring. Choose a shorter session (1.5-2 hours) and mention your fitness level when booking. Good operators in Pembrokeshire and Anglesey run routes specifically for mixed-ability groups.

**"I'm reasonably active — walk, gym, swim occasionally":** You'll be absolutely fine on a standard session. You might be tired by the end but you'll enjoy it. This is the sweet spot for most guided coasteering.

**"I'm very fit — run, swim, climb regularly":** You'll handle anything. Consider booking a longer or more advanced session with bigger jumps, more challenging swimming sections, and exposed cliff traverses. Ask the operator for their most adventurous route.

### The Swimming Factor

This is the honest bit: **if you can't swim confidently in open water, coasteering isn't safe for you** — regardless of the buoyancy aid. You need to be able to:
*   Swim 50 metres without stopping
*   Tread water for a couple of minutes
*   Swim while wearing a wetsuit (which restricts movement)
*   Stay calm when waves splash your face or push you sideways

If you're unsure, try an open water swim in a lake first. It's a very different experience from a pool.

### The Cold Factor

Fitness isn't just about strength and stamina — cold tolerance matters. Welsh sea water ranges from 8-16°C depending on the season. A 5mm wetsuit insulates you, but you'll still feel the cold, especially towards the end of the session. Being cold drains your energy faster. If you really feel the cold, consider:
*   Booking a summer session (July-August) when water is warmest
*   Asking if the operator provides wetsuit gloves and boots
*   Eating a good meal before the session — your body burns calories to stay warm

## Choosing the Right Session

| Session Type | Fitness Needed | Typical Duration | Best For |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Family/beginner | Moderate — can swim 50m | 1.5-2 hours | First-timers, mixed groups |
| Standard/classic | Good — regular light exercise | 2-3 hours | Most adults |
| Advanced/extreme | High — strong swimmer, very fit | 3-4 hours | Experienced, very fit |

Most Pembrokeshire operators offer at least two grades of session. [Find coasteering in Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/coasteering) or [coasteering in Anglesey](/anglesey/things-to-do/coasteering).

## Practical Tips

*   **Be honest when booking.** Operators ask about fitness and swimming ability for safety reasons, not to judge you. Exaggerating puts you and the group at risk.
*   **Tell them about any conditions.** Asthma, heart conditions, joint problems — mention everything. A good operator will work with you to find the right trip.
*   **Warm up beforehand.** A short walk to the launch point helps — and most coasteering starts involve one.
*   **Eat well before the session.** Not a massive meal, but enough fuel. Your body needs energy for both the activity and staying warm.

## The Smart Choice

If you're unsure, book a standard beginner session and be upfront about your fitness level. A good guide adapts the route to the group. You won't be the first nervous, slightly unfit person they've taken out, and you won't be the last. The buoyancy aid keeps you floating, the wetsuit keeps you warm(ish), and the guide keeps you safe. All you need to bring is a can-do attitude and the ability to swim.
