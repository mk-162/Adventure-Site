# When should I avoid visiting North Wales?

## Quick Answer

While North Wales is stunning year-round, avoid the peak summer holiday weeks (late July to late August) if you dislike crowds, especially in popular spots like Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) and Betws-y-Coed. Weekends throughout the year also see higher visitor numbers. For the best balance of good weather and fewer people, consider visiting in late spring (May-June) or early autumn (September-October).

## Navigating Peak Seasons and Events

North Wales sees a surge in visitors during school holidays, particularly the summer break. Expect higher prices for accommodation, fully booked activities (especially with operators like Zip World), and congested roads, especially on the A5 and A55. Popular destinations like Llandudno and Portmeirion become very busy. Specific events like the National Eisteddfod (held in a different location each year) can also significantly impact local accommodation availability and traffic. If you're planning to climb Snowdon, be prepared for long queues at the Llanberis Path and consider pre-booking your parking at Pen y Pass (£10-£15 per day).

Consider that some adventure activities are weather-dependent. High winds can close Zip World Velocity, and heavy rain can make some hiking trails, like those in the Glyderau range, treacherous. Always check the weather forecast and activity provider updates before you travel. While winter can be beautiful, some mountain roads, like the Crimea Pass, may be closed due to snow and ice.

## Comparing Seasons for Activities

Here's a quick guide to help you choose the best time based on your interests:

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Summer (July-Aug) | Coastal activities, family holidays | Varies | Anglesey beaches, Llandudno promenade |
| Spring/Autumn (May-June/Sept-Oct) | Hiking, mountain biking, climbing | Moderate to challenging | Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park |
| Winter (Nov-Feb) | Photography, quiet escapes, experienced mountaineers only | Challenging | Snowdonia mountains |

## Practical Tips

- Book accommodation and activities well in advance, especially if travelling during peak season. Many campsites and B&Bs require deposits.
- Consider using the Sherpa bus service to access popular walking routes around Snowdon to avoid parking hassles.
- Pack for all types of weather, even in summer. Mountain weather can change rapidly.
- Check tide times if you're planning coastal walks or activities. Some beaches, like those around the Llyn Peninsula, disappear entirely at high tide.
