Despite its imposing location, it is surprisingly shallow, with a maximum depth of only about 3 meters. This makes it warmer than deeper lakes but also rocky. It is famously associated with the legend of King Arthur's sword Excalibur (Bedivere casting it into the lake). Access is very easy from the A5 road. It offers iconic views of Tryfan and Pen yr Ole Wen."

Surrounded by the towering cliffs of the Glyderau, the setting is dramatic and moody. Swimming is often debated due to its conservation status, but it remains a bucket-list spot for a quick dip for respectful wild swimmers. The water is crystal clear and cold. Access is via a paved but steep path from Ogwen Cottage."

Located in the Nant Gwynant valley, it is easily accessible from the A498. The lake is popular for kayaking and swimming, particularly from the roadside lay-bys or the campsite at the head of the lake.

Situated high in the Black Mountain range of the Brecon Beacons, it sits beneath a dramatic amphitheatre of cliffs.

It is a remote and hauntingly beautiful location, perfect for those seeking solitude and a connection with Welsh folklore."

It sits beneath the steep escarpment of Fan Brycheiniog. The approach is a hike across open moorland which can be boggy. The lake feels wilder and more open than Fan Fach. It is an atmospheric spot for a swim, surrounded by the brooding presence of the Black Mountain peaks."
tal-y-llyn,Tal-y-llyn Lake (Llyn Mwyngil),snowdonia,52.67250,-3.89744,Ribbon Lake,3,Good,16,Easy,Lay-bys on B4405 or Tywyn,"Shallow weeds, fishing lines",8,B,"Tal-y-llyn Lake, or Llyn Mwyngil, is a stunning ribbon lake at the foot of Cadair Idris in southern Snowdonia. Formed by a massive ancient landslide blocking the valley, it is relatively shallow and famous for its brown trout. Access is very easy via the B4405 road.

Consequently, it can be busy and noisy in summer. However, it is a beautiful spot in the Gwydir Forest. There is a car park and toilets. Swimming is possible but requires vigilance due to boat traffic. It is steeped in history, being the reputed home of the bard Taliesin. Best visited early morning or evening for a quieter dip."
llyn-crafnant,Llyn Crafnant,snowdonia,53.13250,-3.87000,Natural Lake,22,Excellent,15,Easy,Car park near lake or Trefriw,"Fishing lines, cold water",9,A,"Llyn Crafnant is often described as one of the prettiest lakes in Snowdonia, situated in a valley parallel to Geirionydd but much more peaceful. Private boating and swimming are technically restricted in parts due to fishing rights, so discretion is advised (check local signage, often tolerated away from anglers). The scenery is alpine-like with forest meeting the water. A cafe open in summer adds to the appeal. It is a haven for those seeking a quieter experience."

Swimming here offers a spectacular backdrop of Moel Siabod and Snowdon. It's an accessible spot for a quick dip with iconic photographic potential."
llyn-eigiau,Llyn Eigiau,snowdonia,53.16889,-3.91583,Reservoir (Breached),10,Excellent,13,Moderate,Remote car park at end of narrow lane from Tal-y-bont,"Remote, broken dam structures, uneven bottom",8,B,"Llyn Eigiau is a large, shallow lake in the Carneddau, famous for the 1925 dam disaster which destroyed the wall (still visible). The lake is now much smaller than its original reservoir size but retains a wild, remote character. Access involves a drive up a long, narrow lane followed by a walk. It feels very secluded. The water is clear, and the broken dam adds a haunting historic element to the swim. Great for escaping the crowds."

It is a drinking water reservoir, so check current access rules, but it is also a natural lake enlarged by a dam. It supports a population of Arctic Char. The setting is grand and open. The 'Snowdon Ranger' path starts here. Strong winds can funnel through the valley, making the water choppy. Access is easy from the A4085."

It requires an uphill hike to reach, ensuring it is rarely crowded. The water is deep and clear, and the setting is dramatic, often described as one of the finest corrie lakes in Wales. It serves as a reservoir for Bala but retains a very natural feel. A bothy memorial stands nearby. A perfect spot for a wild, high-mountain swim."
llyn-dulyn,Llyn Dulyn,snowdonia,53.18028,-3.94583,Reservoir/Natural,58,Excellent,10,Hard,Remote car park Llyn Eigiau (long walk),"Very cold, deep, plane wreckage, remote",9,B,"Llyn Dulyn ('Black Lake') lives up to its name, sitting in a dark, steep-sided corrie in the Carneddau. It is deep (58m) and notoriously cold. The site is poignant due to several aircraft crashes on the cliffs above; wreckage is sometimes visible. It feels incredibly remote and wild. Swimming here is for the hardy and experienced, offering a sombre but majestic atmosphere. Access is a long trek from Llyn Eigiau or the coast."
llyn-bodlyn,Llyn Bodlyn,snowdonia,52.790,-4.090,Reservoir/Natural,20,Excellent,13,Hard,Talybont (long walk),"Remote, cold",8,B,"Llyn Bodlyn lies high in the Rhinogydd mountains, supplying water to Barmouth. It is reached via a long walk up the Ysgethin valley, passing the historic Pont Scethin packhorse bridge. The lake is backed by the steep slopes of Diffwys and Y Llethr. It has a wild, rugged character typical of the Rhinogs. A stone causeway once existed but was submerged when the lake was dammed. A remote spot for a determined swimmer."
llyn-llydaw,Llyn Llydaw,snowdonia,53.06861,-4.04722,Natural Lake,58,Good,7,Moderate,Pen-y-Pass (Pre-book essential),"Extremely cold (claimed coldest in UK), deep",9,A,"Llyn Llydaw is an iconic glacial lake on the Miners' Track up Snowdon. Famous for its causeway and pipeline, it is heavily visited by walkers but less often swum due to its reputation as the coldest lake in Britain. The setting is magnificent, surrounded by the peaks of the Snowdon Horseshoe. Copper mine ruins line the shore. It is a serious swim for those acclimated to cold water, offering unmatched mountain views."
llyn-cowlyd,Llyn Cowlyd,snowdonia,53.133,-3.917,Reservoir,70,Excellent,11,Moderate,Gate near Trefriw (walk in),"Very deep, steep banks, sudden depth",8,B,"Llyn Cowlyd is the deepest lake in North Wales (70m), a long, dark ribbon of water high in the Carneddau. It is a reservoir held by a high dam and feels bleak and exposed, lacking the softness of lower lakes. It is reached by a hike from Trefriw or Capel Curig. The water is deep and cold. Legends tell of the 'Owl of Cwm Cowlyd'. It is a place for serious swimmers who appreciate a stark, dramatic atmosphere."

It is a bucket-list swim for its incredible setting and the sense of achievement in reaching it."
