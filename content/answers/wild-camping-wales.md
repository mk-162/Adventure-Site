# Can You Wild Camp in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Technically, no — wild camping is not a legal right in Wales (unlike Scotland). However, it's widely tolerated in upland areas of Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons if done responsibly: pitch late, leave early, leave absolutely no trace, and stay above the enclosed farmland line. In practice, thousands of people wild camp in Wales every year without issues. The key is doing it right.

## The Detail

### The Legal Position

Wales follows England's access laws. You have a right to roam on designated open access land, but this doesn't include a right to camp. Technically, you need the landowner's permission. However, in practice:

*   **Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons:** Wild camping above the farmland line is widely tolerated. Mountain summits, high ridges, and remote cwms are traditional wild camping spots. Nobody is going to bother you on a remote hillside if you're respectful.
*   **Coastal areas and lowland:** Much less tolerated. Don't pitch up on beaches, in fields, or near roads. You're more likely to be asked to move on.
*   **Private land:** Always ask permission. Some farmers are happy to let you camp; others aren't. A polite ask goes a long way.

### The Unwritten Rules

These aren't optional — they're what keeps wild camping tolerated in Wales:

*   **Pitch late, leave early.** Arrive after 7pm, be packed up by 8am. You're camping, not occupying.
*   **Leave no trace.** Nothing. Not a single wrapper, not a footprint in soft ground if you can help it. If you carried it in, carry it out.
*   **No fires.** This is non-negotiable in most upland areas. The peat and dry grass are fire risks. Use a camping stove for cooking.
*   **Stay above the enclosed farmland line.** Below the walls and fences is someone's agricultural land. Above is open mountain.
*   **Keep groups small.** One or two tents, not a festival. Large groups attract attention and cause more impact.
*   **Be discreet.** Don't camp where you're visible from roads or villages. Tuck into a sheltered spot out of sight.
*   **Respect water sources.** Don't camp right next to streams or lakes. Use biodegradable soap and dispose of waste water well away from water sources. Dig a cat hole for toilet needs, at least 30m from any water source.

### Best Wild Camping Spots

*   **Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) — Cwm Glas or Llyn Du'r Arddu:** Dramatic mountain camping below Snowdon's north face. Cold, exposed, and absolutely spectacular at sunset.
*   **The Carneddau:** Wales's most remote mountain range. Wild ponies, empty ridges, and a genuine sense of wilderness. Camp by Llyn Dulyn for a magical experience.
*   **Cadair Idris — Llyn Cau:** A stunning glacial lake in a dramatic cwm. One of the most atmospheric wild camp spots in Wales. Arrive via the Minffordd Path.
*   **Brecon Beacons ridge:** The Fan Brycheiniog / Fan Hir ridge offers remote, elevated camping with huge views. Part of the International Dark Sky Reserve — the stargazing is extraordinary.
*   **Rhinogydd (Snowdonia):** Genuinely wild, rough terrain with ancient oak woodland and rocky peaks. Llyn Hywel below Rhinog Fawr is a classic spot.

### What You'll Need

*   **Lightweight tent or bivvy bag.** The lighter and more compact, the better — you're carrying everything uphill.
*   **Sleeping bag rated for the conditions.** Mountain temperatures drop fast after sunset. A 3-season bag minimum; in winter, a 4-season.
*   **Sleeping mat with good insulation.** Ground temperatures are cold.
*   **Camping stove and fuel.** No fires, remember.
*   **Water purification.** Tablets or a filter. Mountain streams look clean but can carry Giardia or agricultural runoff.
*   **Waterproof everything.** Dry bags for sleeping bag and clothes. It will rain.
*   **Headtorch, map, compass.** You're navigating to your pitch in fading light.

## Alternatives to Wild Camping

If the uncertainty of wild camping doesn't appeal, Wales has brilliant alternatives:

*   **Small, off-grid campsites:** Many Welsh campsites are barely a step up from wild camping — a field, a tap, a composting toilet, and stunning views. Sites like Llyn Gwynant in Snowdonia or hillfort sites on the Gower are gorgeous.
*   **Bothies:** A handful of Mountain Bothies Association shelters exist in Snowdonia. Free, basic, and first-come-first-served.
*   **Glamping:** If you want the outdoors without the ground-sleeping, Wales does glamping well. Yurts, pods, and bell tents in spectacular locations.

## The Smart Choice

Wild camping in Wales is one of the most rewarding outdoor experiences you can have — waking up on a mountain with no one else around, watching the sunrise over the Carneddau or the Brecon Beacons. But it's a privilege, not a right. Do it properly: be invisible, leave no trace, and respect the landscape. If everyone follows the unwritten rules, it stays tolerated. If people abuse it, we all lose.
