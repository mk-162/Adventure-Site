# Is Pembrokeshire good for families with children?

## Quick Answer

Absolutely! Pembrokeshire is fantastic for families, offering everything from sandy beaches like Barafundle Bay perfect for sandcastle building to thrilling coasteering adventures with TYF Adventure in St Davids. Plus, there are plenty of family-friendly attractions like Folly Farm Adventure Park and Zoo near Tenby.

## Beaches and Coastal Adventures

Pembrokeshire's coastline is a playground for families. For calm waters and golden sands, head to Broad Haven or Saundersfoot. Barafundle Bay, though a bit of a walk down from the car park, is consistently ranked as one of the UK's best beaches and is ideal for paddling and picnics. Older kids (8+) might enjoy a coasteering session with TYF Adventure; expect to pay around £65 per person for a half-day adventure that includes swimming, climbing, and jumping into the sea. Be aware that some beaches have strong currents; always check local tide times and lifeguard flags. In the summer months, consider a boat trip to Ramsey Island from St Justinians to spot seals and seabirds; tickets cost approximately £30 per adult and £20 per child.

## Animal Encounters and Family Attractions

Beyond the beaches, Pembrokeshire boasts several family-oriented attractions. Folly Farm Adventure Park and Zoo, near Tenby, is a sure hit, with a large collection of animals, fairground rides, and indoor play areas; expect to pay around £20 per person for entry. Alternatively, Oakwood Theme Park offers thrilling rollercoasters for older children and gentler rides for younger ones; ticket prices vary depending on the season but generally range from £25-£35 per person. For a rainy day, consider the Blue Lagoon Water Park; a family ticket (2 adults, 2 children) costs around £70.
