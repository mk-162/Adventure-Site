# Wildlife & Birdwatching in Wales

Wales is quietly one of the best places in Britain for wildlife. From the puffin colonies of Skomer to the red kites circling above Mid Wales and the dolphins of Cardigan Bay, there's something extraordinary in every region — and most of it's accessible without specialist equipment or expert knowledge.

## The Big Draws

### Puffins on Skomer Island
The star attraction. Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, hosts nearly 43,000 Atlantic puffins — the largest colony in southern Britain. From April to late July, puffins waddle along the footpaths within arm's reach. It's a genuinely unforgettable experience.

The island also supports around 350,000 breeding pairs of Manx shearwaters (the world's largest colony), plus thousands of guillemots, razorbills and kittiwakes.

- **How to visit**: Day trips run Tuesday–Sunday, April–September, from Martin's Haven near Marloes. Boat crossing takes about 20 minutes.
- **Booking**: Essential — trips sell out fast, especially May–June. Book through the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales.
- **Cost**: Around £20 for adults (combined boat fare and landing fee), £12 for children.
- **Overnight stays**: Limited self-catering accommodation on the island. Books out months in advance.

### Red Kites at Gigrin Farm
A conservation success story. Red kites were nearly extinct in Britain — down to a handful of breeding pairs in the remote valleys of Mid Wales. Now there are thousands, and the daily feeding at Gigrin Farm near Rhayader attracts up to 600 birds at a time. It's a spectacular sight.

- **Where**: Gigrin Farm, Rhayader, Mid Wales. Daily feeding at 2pm (3pm in summer).
- **Cost**: A few pounds for admission.

### Dolphins in Cardigan Bay
Cardigan Bay is home to the largest resident population of bottlenose dolphins in the UK — around 300 animals. Boat trips from New Quay and Cardigan offer excellent chances of sightings, particularly between May and September. You might also spot harbour porpoises, Atlantic grey seals and occasional sunfish.

### Seals Around the Coast
Grey seals are common around the Welsh coast. The Pembrokeshire islands are particularly good — seal pups are born on the beaches from August to November. Ramsey Island boat trips and Strumble Head are reliable spots.

### RSPB South Stack, Anglesey
Dramatic sea cliffs with nesting seabirds including puffins (smaller colony than Skomer but easier to access), guillemots, razorbills and choughs. The visitor centre has live camera feeds. Best April–July.

## Where to Watch

### Pembrokeshire (Best Overall)
Skomer and Skokholm islands, Ramsey Island boat trips, seal watching at Strumble Head, choughs along the coastal path, Marloes peninsula for passage birds.

### Mid Wales (Best for Raptors)
Red kites at Gigrin Farm, buzzards everywhere, peregrines, ospreys at Cors Dyfi (Dyfi Osprey Project — nest camera and visitor centre). Also excellent for otters on quiet rivers.

### Anglesey (Best for Seabirds)
RSPB South Stack for nesting seabirds, Cemlyn Bay for terns, Newborough Warren for ravens and red squirrels.

### Carmarthenshire / Ceredigion (Best for Marine)
Cardigan Bay dolphins from New Quay. WWT Llanelli Wetland Centre for waders, wildfowl and flamingos. The Teifi estuary for otters.

### Snowdonia (Best for Mountain Wildlife)
Feral goats on the Glyderau, ring ouzels on high crags, peregrines in the passes. Glaslyn ospreys near Porthmadog.

## Practical Tips

- **Binoculars**: Essential for birdwatching. 8x42 is the standard recommendation. Many reserves have hides with telescopes.
- **Timing**: Early morning is best for most wildlife. Puffins are visible all day on Skomer. Seals are tide-dependent.
- **Photography**: Long lenses (300mm+) needed for most birds. Puffins on Skomer are an exception — they come remarkably close.
- **Guided trips**: Worth it for dolphins (boat trips) and island visits. Freelance wildlife guides available in Pembrokeshire and Snowdonia.
- **Respect**: Keep distances, stay on paths, don't disturb nesting birds. Wales takes wildlife protection seriously.

## Best Time to Visit

- **Spring (April–May)**: Puffins arriving, ospreys nesting, seabird colonies filling up. Wildflowers on cliff tops. Probably the best overall.
- **Summer (June–August)**: Peak puffin and seabird season. Dolphins most active. Longest days for watching.
- **Autumn (September–November)**: Seal pups on beaches. Migration passage birds. Red kites feeding spectacular in autumn light.
- **Winter (December–March)**: Huge flocks of waders and wildfowl on estuaries. Red kites year-round. Starling murmurations at some sites.

## Who It's For

Wildlife watching in Wales is genuinely for everyone. Skomer puffins delight children and serious birders equally. Dolphin boat trips are thrilling for families. Red kite feeding is accessible for those with limited mobility. And for dedicated naturalists, Wales offers rare species (choughs, ospreys, polecats, pine martens) that are genuinely hard to find elsewhere in Britain.
