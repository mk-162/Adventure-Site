    "full": "GoSkydive's Swansea dropzone offers the ultimate skydiving experience over one of Wales' most beautiful coastal landscapes. Located at Swansea Airport, just 6 miles from Swansea city centre, this is the newest addition to the GoSkydive family and brings world-class skydiving to South Wales.\n\nWith jumps available from both 10,000ft and 15,000ft, you'll experience between 30-60 seconds of breathtaking freefall at speeds of up to 125mph before your parachute opens and you glide peacefully back to earth. The views are spectacular - soar above the stunning Gower Peninsula coastline, the glittering Bristol Channel, and on clear days you can see across to Devon and Cornwall.\n\nGoSkydive is one of the UK's leading tandem skydiving operators with tens of thousands of successful jumps. Every instructor is highly experienced and qualified, ensuring your safety while making sure you have the time of your life. The dropzone operates every weekend (Saturday and Sunday) from March through November, plus weekdays for larger groups and bank holiday Mondays.\n\nWhether you're jumping for the first time, doing a charity skydive, or gifting an experience to someone special, Swansea offers convenient access from across Wales and the West of England. The site has café facilities on-site, ample parking, and a welcoming atmosphere perfect for nervous first-timers and excited thrill-seekers alike."
