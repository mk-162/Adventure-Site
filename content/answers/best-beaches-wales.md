# What are the Best Beaches in Wales for Adventure?

Rhossili Bay for sheer drama, Freshwater West for surf, and Newgale for everything in between. Wales has over 250 beaches — these are the ones worth travelling for if you want more than just a deckchair.

## Adventure Beaches by Activity

### Surfing

**Freshwater West, Pembrokeshire** — The most consistent surf in [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire). Powerful beach break that works on most swells. Not ideal for beginners when it's firing, but brilliant intermediate territory. No facilities to speak of — that's part of the charm.

**Llangennith, Gower** — The Gower's go-to surf beach. Reliable waves, surf hire on the beach, and a good pub within walking distance. More forgiving than Freshwater West and perfect for learning. Arguably the best beginner surf in [South Wales](/south-wales).

**Whitesands Bay, Pembrokeshire** — Sheltered enough for learners, punchy enough for intermediates. Surf schools operate here throughout summer. Stunning setting beneath Carn Llidi.

### Coasteering & Rock Jumping

**Abereiddy (Blue Lagoon), Pembrokeshire** — The spiritual home of [coasteering](/activities/coasteering) in Wales. The Blue Lagoon itself is a flooded quarry used for cliff jumping, and the coastline either side is prime coasteering territory. Multiple operators run sessions here.

**Three Cliffs Bay, Gower** — Dramatic limestone cliffs, caves, and natural arches. Accessible only on foot, which keeps the crowds thin. Several operators use this stretch for coasteering and scrambling sessions.

### Wild Swimming

**Barafundle Bay, Pembrokeshire** — Regularly voted one of Britain's best beaches, and deserves it. Crystal-clear water, golden sand, no road access (10-minute walk from the car park). The water is genuinely swimmable from June to September.

**Mwnt, Ceredigion** — A hidden cove with dolphins. Seriously — bottlenose dolphins from Cardigan Bay feed close to shore here. The swim is short but the water clarity is exceptional.

### Beach Activities & Families

**Newgale, Pembrokeshire** — Two miles of sand, consistent waves for bodyboarding, and flat enough for land-yachting and kite-buggying when the tide's out. The most versatile adventure beach in Wales.

**Cefn Sidan, Carmarthenshire** — Eight miles of unbroken sand in [Carmarthenshire](/carmarthenshire). Horse riding, land-sailing, and the kind of emptiness you won't find in Devon or Cornwall. Pembrey Country Park sits behind the dunes with bike trails and a dry ski slope.

### Kayaking & SUP

**Porth Oer (Whistling Sands), Llŷn Peninsula** — The sand literally squeaks underfoot. Sheltered bay that's perfect for SUP and sea kayaking, with the Llŷn coastline stretching out either side. Sea conditions are usually calmer than the south-facing coasts.
