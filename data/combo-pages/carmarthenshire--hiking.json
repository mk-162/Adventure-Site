  "introduction": "Carmarthenshire isn't just the 'Garden of Wales'; it's a hiker's paradise. While Snowdonia steals the headlines, the relative quiet of Carmarthenshire offers a more intimate experience with the Welsh landscape. From challenging Black Mountain ascents to gentle ambles through Dinefwr Park, there's something for everyone. Forget the crowds, here you'll find peace and genuinely breathtaking views. \n\nThis isn't to say it's *easy*. The Black Mountain can be unforgiving, and even seemingly gentle trails can turn boggy after rain – so proper footwear and a good map (or GPS) are essential. The beauty of hiking Carmarthenshire lies in its variety. You can conquer a summit one day, and explore ancient woodland the next. And, crucially, you're never far from a cracking pub meal. The Brecon Beacons National Park dips into Carmarthenshire’s east edge, offering some brilliant upland walking.\n\nThe Tywi Valley offers gentler, rolling landscapes ideal for families and less experienced hikers. The network of trails around Aberglasney Gardens and along the river itself provide stunning views and historical interest. However, be prepared for some steep sections, especially on routes leading up to the castles like Carreg Cennen and Dryslwyn. Hiking Carmarthenshire really rewards those seeking to get away from it all, and who enjoy a more authentic experience of the Welsh countryside – boots, map and all!",
