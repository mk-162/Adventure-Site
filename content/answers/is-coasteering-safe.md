# Is Coasteering Safe?

## Quick Answer

**Yes, coasteering is safe when done with qualified, licensed operators.** Wales has an excellent safety record — the activity was invented here in 1986, and thousands of sessions run successfully every year. Serious injuries are rare. However, coasteering does involve real risks (cold water, waves, rocks, heights), so choosing a reputable operator and following their guidance is essential.

## The Safety Record

### What the Data Shows
- **No published fatality data** for guided coasteering in the UK with licensed operators
- **Minor injuries** (scrapes, bruises) are common — wetsuits protect most of your body
- **Serious incidents** are extremely rare when following operator guidelines
- **Most incidents** involve independent swimmers, not guided groups

### Why It's Safer Than It Looks
1. **Operators check conditions** — Sessions are cancelled or relocated in unsafe conditions
2. **Equipment protects you** — Full wetsuits, helmets, and buoyancy aids
3. **Guides know the coastline** — They've done these routes hundreds of times
4. **Jump heights are checked** — Guides check depths before every session
5. **Everything is optional** — No reputable guide will pressure anyone to jump

## What Could Go Wrong?

### Minor Risks (Common)
| Risk | Prevention |
|------|------------|
| **Scrapes and bruises** | Wetsuit covers most skin; accept some grazes |
| **Cold** | Full wetsuits provided; keep moving |
| **Swallowing seawater** | Keep mouth closed; normal |
| **Temporary disorientation** | Follow guide; stay with group |

### Moderate Risks (Uncommon)
| Risk | Prevention |
|------|------------|
| **Twisted ankle** | Good footwear; careful foot placement |
| **Cuts from rocks/barnacles** | Gloves (sometimes provided); mindful climbing |
| **Mild hypothermia** | Time limits; wetsuits; exit protocol |

### Serious Risks (Rare)
| Risk | Prevention |
|------|------------|
| **Impact injury from jump** | Guides check depths; proper technique taught |
| **Drowning** | Buoyancy aids; swimming ability required; ratios maintained |
| **Head injury** | Helmets mandatory; careful movement |
| **Getting swept out/trapped** | Guides know tides; route planning; weather checks |

## How Operators Keep You Safe

### Before You Arrive
- **Weather and sea condition checks** — Sessions postponed in dangerous conditions
- **Route selection** — Different routes for different conditions
- **Tide planning** — Sessions timed around optimal tide states
- **Equipment maintenance** — Regular inspection of wetsuits, helmets, buoyancy aids

### At the Session
- **Safety briefing** — Techniques for jumping, swimming, climbing
- **Continuous assessment** — Guides watch for cold, fatigue, anxiety
- **Group ratios** — Typically 1 guide per 6-8 participants
- **Communication** — Clear signals and protocols
- **Alternative routes** — Options for nervous participants

### What to Look For in an Operator

#### Essential (Non-Negotiable)
| Credential | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **AALA License** | Adventure Activities Licensing Authority — legal requirement for commercial operators working with young people |
| **Qualified guides** | BCU/Paddlesports Coach, Beach Lifeguard, or equivalent |
| **First aid trained** | All guides have current first aid certificates |
| **Public liability insurance** | Minimum £5 million coverage |

#### Good Signs
- Member of Adventure Activities Industry Advisory Committee (AAIAC)
- Operating for 10+ years with good reviews
- Clear safety information on website
- They ask about your swimming ability and health conditions
- Willing to answer safety questions

#### Red Flags
- No mention of qualifications or licensing
- Won't discuss safety protocols
- Pressure to do jumps you're uncomfortable with
- Equipment looks old or poorly maintained
- Operating in clearly unsafe conditions

### Top Welsh Operators (All Licensed & Qualified)

| Operator | Location | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **TYF Adventure** | Pembrokeshire | Invented coasteering in 1986 |
| **Celtic Quest** | Pembrokeshire | Operating since 1990s |
| **Preseli Venture** | Pembrokeshire | Multi-award winning |
| **Rip N Rock** | Gower | Established operator |
| **Seren Ventures** | Anglesey | Northern Wales specialists |
| **North Wales Active** | Anglesey | Good family options |

## Your Responsibilities

### Before Booking
- **Be honest about swimming ability** — You need to swim confidently
- **Disclose medical conditions** — Asthma, epilepsy, heart conditions, pregnancy
- **Mention fears** — Heights, water, confined spaces — guides adapt
- **Ask questions** — Good operators welcome them

### During the Session
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Listen to your guide | Ignore instructions |
| Stay with the group | Go off exploring alone |
| Ask if unsure | Pretend you understood |
| Say no to jumps if nervous | Feel pressured to jump |
| Keep moving to stay warm | Stand around getting cold |
| Watch where others go | Rush ahead |

### Who Shouldn't Go
- **Non-swimmers** — You must be able to swim short distances
- **Pregnant women** — Risk of impact
- **Serious heart/lung conditions** — Consult GP first
- **Recent back/neck injuries** — Jumping not advisable
- **Under the influence** — Alcohol/drugs = refused entry

## Special Considerations

### Children (Ages 8-16)
- Must be confident swimmers
- Accompanied by participating adult (most operators)
- Family sessions use easier routes with smaller jumps
- Excellent safety record for children

### Non-Confident Adults
- **Tell the guide** — They will adapt the experience
- **Skip any jump** — Everything is optional
- **Stay close to guide** — They'll give extra support
- **Start with "family" or "classic" sessions** — Less challenging routes

### Rough Weather
Good operators will:
- Cancel if conditions are dangerous
- Switch to sheltered coastline sections
- Shorten sessions if conditions deteriorate
- **Never** operate in genuinely unsafe conditions

## The Real Risk Perspective

### Comparable Activities
Coasteering's risk profile is similar to:
- Open water swimming (cold water, currents)
- Scrambling/easy rock climbing (falls, scrapes)
- Kayaking (cold water, waves)

All carry risk; all are managed safely by professionals every day.

### What's More Dangerous Than Coasteering?
For context, these activities have higher injury rates:
- Horse riding
- Skiing
- Rugby
- Cycling on roads
- DIY

### The Biggest Actual Risk
**The drive to the coastline** is statistically more dangerous than the coasteering itself.

## The Bottom Line

Coasteering with a licensed operator is a managed-risk adventure. You will:
- Get cold (wetsuits help)
- Get scraped (minor)
- Feel nervous (that's part of it)
- Probably swallow some seawater

You almost certainly won't:
- Get seriously injured
- Drown
- Be forced to do anything unsafe

**Choose a reputable operator, listen to your guide, and enjoy one of the best adventure experiences Wales offers.**
