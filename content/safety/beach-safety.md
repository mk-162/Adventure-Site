# Beach Safety in Wales

Welsh beaches are stunning. They can also be dangerous if you don't respect the sea. Every year, the RNLI rescues hundreds of people around the Welsh coast — most of whom got into trouble through simple lack of awareness rather than reckless behaviour. A few minutes of preparation makes all the difference.

## Tides — The Number One Thing

Welsh tides are among the most dramatic in the world. The Bristol Channel has one of the highest tidal ranges on the planet — up to 14 metres at some points. Even on the west coast and Anglesey, the difference between high and low tide transforms beaches completely.

### Why This Matters
- **Beaches disappear**: Caswell Bay on the Gower has a gorgeous sandy beach at low tide. At high tide, there's virtually no beach at all. Three Cliffs Bay becomes completely cut off by the incoming tide. People get trapped against cliffs every year.
- **Worm's Head, Rhossili**: Accessible at low tide, it's a dramatic headland walk. But the causeway covers quickly, and if you mistime it, you're stuck on the rocks for 5+ hours until the next low tide. The coastguard knows this spot by name.
- **Llanddwyn Island, Anglesey**: Same situation — accessible at low tide, cut off at high. Magical, but check the tide tables.

### What To Do
- **Check tide times before every visit**: Available free at tidetimes.org.uk or the BBC Weather app. Takes 30 seconds.
- **Arrive on a falling tide if possible**: The beach gets bigger, you don't get surprised.
- **Watch for the turn**: When the tide starts coming in, it can move surprisingly fast, especially on flat beaches. Start packing up early.
- **Know your escape route**: On cliff-backed beaches, identify how you get out at high tide before you settle in. Some beaches have no high-tide escape.

## Rip Currents

Rip currents are strong channels of water flowing away from the shore. They're present at many Welsh beaches, particularly the more exposed ones, and they catch people out every summer.

### Where They Happen
Most common at:
- **Freshwater West, Pembrokeshire** — powerful rips, not for casual swimmers
- **Llangennith/Rhossili, Gower** — rips form around sandbanks, especially mid-tide
- **Whitesands Bay, Pembrokeshire** — generally manageable but rips present
- **Newgale, Pembrokeshire** — exposed beach with known rip currents

### How To Spot Them
- A channel of darker, calmer-looking water between areas of breaking waves
- Foam, seaweed or debris moving steadily seaward
- A gap in the line of breaking waves

### If You're Caught In One
1. **Don't panic** — rips won't pull you under, they pull you out
2. **Don't fight it** — swimming against a rip current is exhausting and often impossible
3. **Swim parallel to the shore** until you're out of the rip (usually 10–30 metres wide)
4. **Then swim back to shore** at an angle
5. **If you can't escape, float and raise an arm** — conserve energy and signal for help

## Lifeguarded Beaches

The RNLI patrols many Welsh beaches from May to September. **Always swim between the red and yellow flags** — this is the area lifeguards have assessed as safest.

### Key Lifeguarded Beaches
- **Gower**: Caswell Bay, Langland Bay, Llangennith, Port Eynon, Rhossili
- **Pembrokeshire**: Whitesands, Newgale, Broad Haven, Freshwater West, Tenby South Beach, Poppit Sands
- **Anglesey**: Benllech, Trearddur Bay
- **North Wales**: Barmouth, Aberdovey, Harlech

Check the [RNLI beach finder](https://rnli.org/find-my-nearest/lifeguarded-beaches) for current patrol dates and times.

### Flag Meanings
- 🔴🟡 **Red and yellow flags**: Lifeguarded area — swim here
- ⚫🟡 **Black and white checkered flags**: Surfing/bodyboarding zone — no swimming
- 🔴 **Red flag**: Danger — do not enter the water
- 🟠 **Orange windsock**: Offshore wind warning — inflatables will be blown out to sea

## Cold Water

The sea around Wales is cold. Even in August — the warmest month — water temperatures typically peak at 15–17°C. In spring and early summer, 10–13°C is normal.

### Why This Matters
- **Cold water shock**: Entering cold water suddenly causes an involuntary gasp reflex. If your head is underwater, you inhale water. This kills people every year.
- **Enter gradually**: Walk in slowly, splash water on your face and chest, let your body adjust.
- **Wetsuits help enormously**: Even a cheap 3mm wetsuit extends your comfortable time in the water from 10 minutes to over an hour.
- **Know your limits**: Cold water saps energy faster than you think. If you start shivering, get out.
- **After swimming**: Warm up gradually. Hot drinks, dry clothes, shelter from wind. "After-drop" (continued cooling after you get out) is real — you can feel colder 10 minutes after leaving the water.

## Children and Families

- **Never take your eyes off children near the sea** — even paddling depth water can knock a small child over
- **Inflatables are dangerous**: Offshore winds blow them out to sea incredibly quickly. The RNLI's biggest headache on busy summer days. Use them in pools, not the sea.
- **Rock pools are brilliant** but wet rocks are slippery. Wellies or water shoes for kids.
- **Dig awareness**: If kids dig a deep hole in the sand, fill it in before you leave. Collapsed sand holes have caused fatalities.

## Cliff Safety

Welsh coastal cliffs are beautiful and unstable.
- **Stay well back from cliff edges** — paths along the top can be undercut
- **Don't shelter at the base of cliffs** — rockfalls happen, especially after rain
- **Don't climb sea cliffs without proper equipment and experience**
- **The Wales Coast Path** is well-maintained but has steep sections — stick to the path

## Dogs on Beaches

- Many Welsh beaches restrict dogs May–September. Check local signs.
- Off-season, dogs are welcome almost everywhere. Keep them under control near wildlife (seals, nesting birds).
- **Dog-friendly year-round**: Mewslade Bay (Gower), Barafundle Bay (Pembrokeshire — though check seasonal notices), most Anglesey beaches.

## Sun Safety

Yes, even in Wales. Reflected UV off water and sand means you burn faster on the beach than you'd expect, even on overcast days.
- SPF 30+ minimum
- Reapply after swimming
- Hats and shade for children
- Peak UV: 11am–3pm

## What to Pack

- Tide times (saved on your phone)
- Suncream
- Wetsuit or rash vest (even for paddling if it's windy)
- Water shoes or old trainers (for rocky beaches)
- Windbreak
- Warm layers for after swimming
- Water and snacks (some of the best beaches have zero facilities)
- Phone in a waterproof case
- First aid basics

## Emergency Numbers

- **Coastguard**: 999, ask for Coastguard (for any emergency on the coast or in the sea)
- **RNLI**: Non-emergency advice: 0800 328 0600
- If you see someone in difficulty in the sea: **Call 999 immediately**. Don't go in after them unless you're trained — too many would-be rescuers drown.
