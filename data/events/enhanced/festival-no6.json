  "description": "Festival No.6 was an award-winning arts, music, and culture festival that transformed the fantastical Italianate village of Portmeirion into a weekend wonderland. Named after Patrick McGoohan's character in The Prisoner (filmed at Portmeirion), the festival ran from 2012 to 2017, earning a reputation as the UK's most unique festival setting. Eclectic lineups ranged from New Order to Noel Gallagher, with comedy, spoken word, and avant-garde performances in Portmeirion's surreal piazzas and woodland stages. Though the main festival has ended, Portmeirion continues to host smaller events, and the village remains a magical destination – living proof that the festival's spirit of creative escapism endures in this extraordinary place.",
