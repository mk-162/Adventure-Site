# What Are the Best Family Adventures in Anglesey?

## Quick Answer

Anglesey is brilliant for families — beaches, wildlife, castles, and adventure activities without the crushing crowds of Snowdonia. The beaches around Newborough Warren are enormous and family-friendly, [coasteering at Rhoscolyn](/anglesey/things-to-do/coasteering) works for kids aged 8+, and the South Stack cliffs are mesmerising for all ages. It's an island that rewards exploration.

## The Detail

### Beaches

Anglesey's beaches are some of the best in North Wales, and several are perfect for families:

*   **Newborough Warren / Llanddwyn Island:** A massive sandy beach backed by forest and dunes. At low tide you can walk across to Llanddwyn Island — a magical spot with lighthouse ruins and views to Snowdonia. The forest walk from the car park is lovely in itself. Parking charge applies.
*   **Trearddur Bay:** Sheltered, sandy, and safe for swimming. Good rock pools at low tide. Close to amenities in Trearddur Bay village. Popular with families and fills up in summer — arrive before 10am.
*   **Benllech:** Long sandy beach with gentle waves, perfect for younger children. The village has shops and a chippy. One of the most accessible beaches on the island.
*   **Cable Bay (Porth Trecastell):** A beautiful horseshoe-shaped bay with sand and rock pools. Less well-known than Trearddur, so quieter. Parking right by the beach.

### Adventure Activities

*   **Coasteering (ages 8+):** Anglesey's coasteering is different from Pembrokeshire — narrower gullies, sea caves, and interesting rock formations around Rhoscolyn and the South Stack area. Several operators run family-friendly sessions with smaller jumps and gentler routes. [Find coasteering in Anglesey](/anglesey/things-to-do/coasteering).
*   **Sea kayaking:** Sheltered bays make Anglesey excellent for family kayaking. Paddle around the coast spotting seals, explore sea caves, and land on hidden beaches. [Find kayaking in Anglesey](/anglesey/things-to-do/kayaking).
*   **Rock pooling:** The rocky coastline is teeming with life. Trearddur Bay and Cable Bay have excellent rock pools at low tide — bring nets, buckets, and a marine ID chart.
*   **Cycling:** Anglesey is flat enough for family cycling. The Lôn Las Cefni path from Llangefni to Newborough is traffic-free and scenic. The coastal sections of Lôn Las Cymru are also good.

### Wildlife and Nature

*   **South Stack RSPB Reserve:** Dramatic sea cliffs with thousands of nesting seabirds (puffins, guillemots, razorbills) from April to July. The cliff paths are spectacular. The lighthouse is worth the steep steps down. The Ellins Tower birdwatching centre has telescopes for kids to use.
*   **Anglesey Sea Zoo:** A marine aquarium showcasing local marine life. Not huge, but educational and engaging for younger children. Good rainy-day option.
*   **Seal watching:** Grey seals are common around Anglesey's coast, especially in autumn. Boat trips from Beaumaris offer wildlife spotting cruises.

### Heritage and Rainy Days

*   **Beaumaris Castle:** Edward I's unfinished masterpiece. UNESCO World Heritage Site. The moat and concentric design fascinate kids, and it's compact enough to explore in an hour. Right on the Menai Strait with views to Snowdonia.
*   **Plas Newydd (National Trust):** A grand house on the Menai Strait with beautiful gardens, a military museum, and woodland walks. The Rex Whistler mural room is extraordinary.
*   **Anglesey Model Village (Newborough):** Small-scale models of Anglesey landmarks. Charming for younger children.

## Practical Tips

*   **Getting there:** Anglesey is connected to the mainland by two bridges. The A55 brings you straight from the M56/Chester in about 90 minutes.
*   **Accommodation:** Plenty of options from campsites to holiday cottages. Beaumaris, Benllech, and Trearddur Bay are good family bases.
*   **Eating out:** The Lobster Pot in Church Bay is excellent (book ahead). The White Eagle at Rhoscolyn has great views. Beaumaris has several family-friendly options.
*   **Combine with Snowdonia:** Anglesey is 20-30 minutes from Bangor and Caernarfon. Easy to combine beach days on Anglesey with mountain adventures in Snowdonia.

## The Smart Choice

Base yourself on Anglesey for a family holiday if your kids love beaches, wildlife, and gentle adventure. Use it as a launchpad for day trips into Snowdonia when you want mountains or bigger thrills. The island has a completely different feel from the mainland — quieter, more relaxed, and with a strong sense of Welsh culture and language.
