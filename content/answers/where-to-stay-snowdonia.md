# Where Should I Stay in Snowdonia?

## Quick Answer

**Betws-y-Coed** is the best all-round base — central, well-connected, with shops, restaurants, and outdoor gear stores. **Llanberis** is ideal if Snowdon is your priority. **Beddgelert** is the prettiest village. **Blaenau Ffestiniog** is the budget option near Zip World. Your choice depends on what you want to do and how much you want to spend.

## The Detail

### Betws-y-Coed — Best All-Round Base

The unofficial capital of Snowdonia. Sits at a junction of valleys with good road connections to most of the park. Walking distance to Swallow Falls, Fairy Glen, and several trail heads. Good range of accommodation from hostels to B&Bs to hotels. Several outdoor shops (Cotswold, Ellis Brigham) for last-minute gear. Restaurants and pubs including the excellent Ty Gwyn Hotel.

**Best for:** Families, first-time visitors, mixed itineraries combining hiking with mountain biking at Gwydir Forest and Coed y Brenin.

**Drawback:** Can feel touristy in peak summer. Traffic through the village centre gets busy.

### Llanberis — Best for Snowdon

Right at the foot of Snowdon with direct access to the Llanberis Path (easiest route). Also home to the National Slate Museum (free), the Electric Mountain tour, and Pete's Eats (legendary climber café). The Pen y Pass car park for the Pyg and Miners' tracks is a 10-minute drive (or take the Sherpa bus).

**Best for:** Climbing Snowdon, the climbing community (Llanberis Pass crags are minutes away), Zip World Velocity (20 minutes to Bethesda). [Find hiking in Snowdonia](/snowdonia/things-to-do/hiking).

**Drawback:** Less picturesque than Beddgelert. Fewer restaurant options.

### Beddgelert — Most Picturesque

A beautiful stone village at the confluence of two rivers, surrounded by mountains. The Aberglaslyn Pass walk starts from the village. Gelert's Grave is a nice little story. Great pubs and a few good restaurants. Feels genuinely Welsh — less touristy than Betws-y-Coed.

**Best for:** Couples, walkers who want a scenic base, those planning to explore the Nantlle Ridge or southern Snowdonia. Access to the Watkin Path up Snowdon.

**Drawback:** More limited accommodation. Fewer shops and services. Slightly further from the main trail centres.

### Blaenau Ffestiniog — Budget & Zip World

A former slate mining town with a dramatic, industrial landscape. Not conventionally pretty, but atmospheric and increasingly popular thanks to Zip World (Bounce Below, Titan, and Zip World Caverns are here or nearby). Accommodation is cheaper than the honeypot villages. The Ffestiniog Railway runs from here to Porthmadog.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious visitors, Zip World enthusiasts, mountain bikers heading to Antur Stiniog. [Find zip lines in Snowdonia](/snowdonia/things-to-do/zip-lining).

**Drawback:** Limited evening options. The weather here is genuinely grim sometimes (at the entrance to a valley that funnels rain).

### Capel Curig — For Serious Outdoors Types

A tiny village between Betws-y-Coed and Llanberis. Home to **Plas y Brenin**, the national outdoor centre, which runs courses in climbing, mountaineering, and kayaking. Closest base to Ogwen Valley (Tryfan, Idwal Slabs, the Glyderau). The Bryn Tyrch pub is excellent.

**Best for:** Climbers, mountaineers, experienced hikers wanting quick access to the Glyderau and Carneddau. [Find climbing in Snowdonia](/snowdonia/things-to-do/climbing).

**Drawback:** Very limited services — one pub, one shop, one café. You'll need a car.

### Dolgellau — Southern Snowdonia

A handsome market town south of the main Snowdonia peaks. Gateway to Cadair Idris and Coed y Brenin mountain bike trails. The Mawddach Trail (flat cycle path to Barmouth) starts nearby. More relaxed atmosphere than the northern villages.

**Best for:** Mountain bikers, Cadair Idris hikers, families wanting a quieter base. [Find mountain biking in Snowdonia](/snowdonia/things-to-do/mountain-biking).

## Accommodation Types

| Type | Budget | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| Hostels (YHA, independent) | £20-35/night | Solo travellers, groups, budget |
| B&Bs and guesthouses | £80-130/night | Couples, comfort without hotel prices |
| Holiday cottages | £400-1200/week | Families, groups, self-catering |
| Hotels | £100-200/night | Comfort, convenience, restaurants |
| Camping/glamping | £15-60/night | Adventurous types, families |

**Book early for summer.** Snowdonia accommodation in July-August fills up months ahead, especially cottages and popular B&Bs. Christmas/New Year also gets booked early.

## Practical Tips

*   **Don't stay too far from your activities.** Snowdonia's roads are slow — a 20-mile drive can take an hour on winding single-track roads. Base yourself near what you want to do.
*   **Consider two bases.** If you're staying a week, splitting between a northern base (Betws-y-Coed/Llanberis) and a southern one (Dolgellau) gives better access to the whole park.
*   **Parking matters.** Some villages have limited parking. If your accommodation doesn't include parking, check before you arrive.
*   **Pubs are your evening entertainment.** Snowdonia villages are small. A great pub makes a great holiday.

## The Smart Choice

First visit, one base? **Betws-y-Coed.** Climbing Snowdon as the main event? **Llanberis.** Romance and scenery? **Beddgelert.** Zip World and budget? **Blaenau Ffestiniog.** Serious climbing and mountaineering? **Capel Curig.** Mountain biking? **Dolgellau.**
