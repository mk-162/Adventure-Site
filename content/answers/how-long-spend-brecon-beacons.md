# How many days should I spend in Brecon Beacons?

## Quick Answer

To truly experience the Brecon Beacons National Park, aim for at least three full days. This allows you to tackle a challenging hike like Pen y Fan, explore the waterfalls in Waterfall Country, and enjoy some stargazing in this designated Dark Sky Reserve. For a more relaxed pace with time for activities like kayaking or cycling, consider a five-day trip.

## Crafting Your Brecon Beacons Itinerary

The ideal length of your Brecon Beacons adventure depends on your interests and fitness level. A shorter, action-packed three-day trip could focus on conquering Pen y Fan via the Storey Arms route (£5 parking), followed by exploring the stunning waterfalls around Ystradfellte, such as Sgwd yr Eira (wear waterproofs – you can walk behind it!). Evenings can be spent stargazing; download a Dark Sky Discovery Site map for the best spots.

For a longer five-day stay, incorporate activities like canoeing or kayaking on the River Wye with providers like Wye Adventures based near Glasbury (£40-£60 per person). Explore the charming market town of Hay-on-Wye, known for its bookshops. Seasonally, consider that winter brings challenging hiking conditions, while summer sees more crowds, especially on Pen y Fan. Shoulder seasons (spring/autumn) offer a good balance.

## Practical Tips

- Download the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority's app for trail maps and information; mobile signal can be patchy in remote areas.
- For a unique experience, book a guided foraging walk with a local expert to learn about edible plants and fungi (seasonal, typically £30-£50).
- Parking at popular trailheads like Pen y Fan fills up quickly, especially on weekends and during school holidays. Arrive early or consider using the T4 TrawsCymru bus service.
- Be prepared for changeable weather, even in summer. Pack layers, waterproofs, and sturdy hiking boots. Check the weather forecast before you set out.
