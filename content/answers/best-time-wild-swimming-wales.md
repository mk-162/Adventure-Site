# What is the best time of year for Wild Swimming in Wales?

## Quick Answer

The best time for wild swimming in Wales is generally between June and September, when the water temperatures are at their warmest. However, experienced wild swimmers often brave the waters year-round, with the right preparation and equipment. Always check local conditions and be aware of tides and currents, especially when swimming in the sea.

## Prime Swimming Season: June to September

During the summer months, the sea around the Gower Peninsula can reach a relatively balmy 16-18°C, making it ideal for longer swims. Inland lakes like Llyn Ogwen in Eryri (Snowdonia) also become more inviting, though they remain significantly colder, typically around 12-15°C. Several operators, such as TYF Adventure in St Davids, offer guided wild swimming experiences during this period, catering to different skill levels, with prices ranging from £45-£75 per person. Keep an eye on the weather forecast, as even in summer, conditions can change rapidly in Wales.

For a more secluded swim, consider heading to Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. You can find hidden coves and beaches that offer shelter from the wind. However, be mindful of strong currents in certain areas. Always swim with a buddy and use a brightly colored tow float to increase visibility. Remember that while the summer offers the warmest temperatures, it's also the busiest time of year, so expect popular spots to be more crowded.

## Year-Round Dipping: For the Brave

Wild swimming doesn't stop when summer ends. Many hardy souls swim throughout the year, experiencing the invigorating chill of the Welsh waters. Wetsuits, gloves, and neoprene socks are essential for winter swimming, with water temperatures plummeting to 5-8°C. Locations like the Blue Lagoon near Abereiddi offer some protection from the elements, but even here, swims should be short and carefully planned.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Summer Sea Swim | Beginners, longer swims | Easy to Moderate (depending on location) | Gower Peninsula, Pembrokeshire Coast |
| Summer Lake Swim | Experienced swimmers, shorter dips | Moderate to Hard (cold water) | Llyn Ogwen, Llyn Padarn |
| Winter Dip | Experienced cold-water swimmers | Hard (very cold water) | Blue Lagoon, Abereiddi |

## Practical Tips

- Check the tide times before sea swimming; low tide often reveals more accessible beaches and safer swimming areas. Websites like the Met Office provide accurate forecasts.
- Invest in a good quality tow float; it not only increases your visibility but also provides a place to rest if needed.
- Be aware of potential hazards such as jellyfish, especially during the summer months.
- If you're new to wild swimming, start with a guided session from a reputable operator like Celtic Quest Coasteering in Pembrokeshire.
- Always tell someone where you're going and when you expect to be back.
