Freezing water, gnarly wind, but a unique buzz for those brave enough to give it a go.\n\n# Coasteering in January: Are We Mad?\n\nRight, let's get this straight from the off. Coasteering in Pembrokeshire in January isn’t for the faint of heart. Or those who don't like being really, *really* cold. But sometimes, the best adventures are the slightly daft ones, aren’t they? I’d been itching for a proper blast since the summer, and the lure of an empty coastline was too much to resist.\n\n## Why January?\n\nHonestly? Pure bloody-mindedness. Everyone says it’s too cold, too rough, too miserable. That just makes me want to do it more. There's a certain bleak beauty to the Pembrokeshire coast in winter. The beaches are deserted, the seals are playful, and the waves are… well, let’s just say energetic. Plus, finding a slot with [TYF Adventure](https://tyf.com) in St Davids in the height of summer can be a right pain, and the relative quiet of January made it a much simpler booking.\n\nOf course, there are downsides. Daylight is limited, so you're looking at shorter sessions. And the weather can turn on a dime. You'll need to keep a close eye on the forecast.\n\n## The Gear and the Grind\n\nI kitted myself out with a decent 5mm wetsuit, hood, gloves, and booties. Don’t even think about skimping on the neoprene. Hypothermia is a real risk, and nobody wants that. A decent base layer underneath the wetsuit is a must – I swear by merino wool. It wicks away moisture and keeps you surprisingly warm, even when soaked.\n\nWe met the TYF crew at their base in St Davids. The car park there can get busy, even in January. Expect to pay around £3 for a few hours. The team were thorough with the safety briefing. They checked everyone's gear, gave clear instructions, and generally filled us with confidence (while also not downplaying the potential for things to get a bit hairy). It was reassuring, especially given the conditions. A few years ago I went out with a different operator - I won't name them - and the briefing was rushed and a bit slapdash. Always check that the operator is reputable and takes safety seriously. Preseli Venture are another great operator, and I've heard good things about Activity Pembrokeshire.\n\nWe piled into the van for the short drive to the coast. We were coasteering near Porthclais harbour, a spot I know well from summer kayak trips. You can also head further south near Stackpole Quay, but be warned the parking there is National Trust and they are strict about closing times.\n\n## Plunge Time\n\nThe water… well, it was bracing. A proper January slap in the face. But once you get moving, the cold becomes strangely invigorating. The waves were definitely up, crashing against the rocks with a satisfying roar. We scrambled over slippery seaweed-covered boulders, plunged into churning gullies, and even braved a few small jumps (nothing too crazy – I value my bones).\n\nThere were six of us in the group, plus two instructors. The others were a mix of locals and adventurous tourists. Everyone was buzzing with nervous energy. A couple of people looked like they were regretting their decisions about halfway through, but they stuck it out.\n\nOne thing I hadn't expected was the wildlife. We spotted a few seals basking on the rocks, seemingly unfazed by the crashing waves. They were surprisingly curious, popping their heads up to give us a good look. It was a special moment, a reminder of the wildness of this coastline.\n\n## Near Disaster\n\nThings took a bit of a turn when a rogue wave caught me off guard. I was scrambling around a rock face, trying to find a good handhold, when *whoosh*. Suddenly I was underwater, getting tossed around like a rag doll. The wetsuit kept me buoyant, but I was disoriented and struggling to get my bearings. Thankfully, one of the instructors was right there, grabbing my arm and hauling me to safety. It was a good reminder that even with experienced guides, things can go wrong quickly in the sea.\n\n## Warming Up\n\nBack at the TYF centre, the hot showers were pure bliss. Followed by a steaming mug of tea, of course. It's a far cry from a warm coffee on the beach at Whitesands in the summer, but that makes it all the more rewarding. I'd booked a session for £60, and honestly, it was worth every penny.\n\n## Who Should (and Shouldn’t) Do This?\n\nCoasteering in January is definitely not for everyone.\n\n**Who should do it:**\n\n*   Adventurous types who don't mind a bit of discomfort.\n*   People with a good level of fitness and some experience in the sea.\n*   Anyone who wants to experience the Pembrokeshire coast in a unique and challenging way.\n\n**Who should skip it:**\n\n*   Those who are easily cold or dislike being wet.\n*   Anyone with pre-existing medical conditions (check with your doctor first).\n*   People who are uncomfortable in the sea or have a fear of heights.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nIf January coasteering sounds a bit too extreme, there are plenty of other things to do in Pembrokeshire. [Hiking](regions/pembrokeshire) the Pembrokeshire Coast Path is a great option year-round, as long as you're prepared for all types of weather. You could try [wild swimming](regions/pembrokeshire) in a sheltered bay – although you'll still need a decent wetsuit! Or, if you fancy sticking to dry land, explore the rugged beauty of [Snowdonia](regions/snowdonia).\n\n## The Verdict\n\nCoasteering in January? Absolutely mental. But also, absolutely brilliant. It's a challenging, exhilarating, and unforgettable experience. Just be prepared for the cold, the waves, and the occasional near-death experience. And for gawd's sake, wear a good wetsuit!",
