## Tips for a Great Zip Line Experience

*   **Book in advance:** Zip lines, especially Velocity 2, are extremely popular and often sell out weeks or even months in advance. Book online to secure your spot.
*   **Check the weather:** While some zip lines operate in most weather conditions, high winds can sometimes lead to closures. Check the forecast before you go and be prepared for potential changes.
*   **Wear appropriate clothing:** Dress in comfortable layers, as the weather in Snowdonia can be unpredictable. Closed-toe shoes are a must. Avoid loose clothing that could get caught in the equipment.
*   **Arrive early:** Give yourself plenty of time to find the location, park, and check in. There's often a briefing and safety demonstration before your zip line adventure.
*   **Listen to the instructors:** Pay close attention to the safety instructions and follow the guidelines provided by the instructors. They are there to ensure your safety and enjoyment.
*   **Consider combining it with other activities:** Snowdonia offers a wealth of outdoor adventures, from hiking Snowdon to mountain biking and gorge walking. Why not make it a multi-activity trip?
