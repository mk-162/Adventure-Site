# What is Coasteering?

## Quick Answer

Coasteering is an adventure activity where you traverse a rocky coastline by swimming, scrambling, climbing, and jumping off cliffs into the sea. You wear a wetsuit, buoyancy aid, and helmet. It was **invented in Pembrokeshire in 1986** by TYF Adventure, and Wales remains one of the best places in the world to do it — with dramatic sea caves, clear waters, and a coastline sculpted by millennia of Atlantic waves.

## The Detail

Coasteering is more than just a walk along the beach — it's exploring the bit of coastline you'd normally only see from above. A typical session involves:

*   **Kitting up:** Full 5mm wetsuit (you'll need it — Welsh water ranges from 8°C in winter to 16°C in August), buoyancy aid, and helmet. All operators provide everything except swimwear and old trainers.
*   **Coastal traversing:** Following a guide, you'll scramble across rocks, wade through channels, and swim between sections. You'll use your hands, feet, and occasionally your courage.
*   **Cliff jumping:** The signature element. Jumps range from 1-metre "steps" to 8-metre+ leaps for the genuinely brave. Always optional — no reputable guide will pressure you. They check depth and conditions before every jump.
*   **Sea caves and gullies:** Many routes thread through sea caves, narrow gullies, and natural arches. At Abereiddy's Blue Lagoon in Pembrokeshire, you might swim into caves carved from volcanic rock and experience "The Flush" — a natural wave-surge tunnel.
*   **Wildlife encounters:** Seals are common in Pembrokeshire and Anglesey. You'll see them bobbing in the water watching you as curiously as you're watching them. Seal pups appear from September onwards.

### What makes it different from other water activities?

Coasteering combines elements of swimming, rock climbing, and cliff jumping into one session. Unlike [kayaking](/activities/kayaking) (where you stay in a boat) or [surfing](/activities/surfing) (where you're riding waves), coasteering puts you right at the interface between land and sea. It's more physical than a [wild swim](/activities/wild-swimming) and more varied than a beach day. The closest comparison is [gorge walking](/activities/gorge-walking), but in saltwater along the coast rather than freshwater in a river canyon.

## Where to Go Coasteering in Wales

### Pembrokeshire — The Birthplace
The **original and still the best**. The Blue Lagoon at Abereiddy (a flooded Victorian slate quarry), the cliffs around St Davids, and the bays near Solva offer incredible coastline. Crystal-clear water, dramatic geology, and the highest concentration of operators in Wales.

**Key spots:**
- **Abereiddy Blue Lagoon** — Iconic flooded quarry with sea caves, cliff jumps from 3-10m, and "The Flush" wave tunnel
- **St Davids Peninsula** — Dramatic cliffs, sea arches, seal colonies
- **Solva & Newgale** — Varied routes suitable for all abilities

### Anglesey
Different character — sea caves, narrow gullies, and interesting rock formations. **Rhoscolyn** is particularly good with jumps ranging from 1-15 metres. Less crowded than Pembrokeshire, with excellent wildlife.

### Gower Peninsula
Closer to Cardiff and Swansea. Beautiful coastline at **Rhossili** and **Three Cliffs Bay** with magnificent sea arches and through-cliff swims. Jumps typically 8-15m at the dramatic spots. Good if you don't want to travel far west.

### Llŷn Peninsula
More remote, fewer people, equally stunning. The coasteering around Aberdaron is wild and beautiful, with the added bonus of views toward Bardsey Island.

## What You'll Need

Operators provide the wetsuit, buoyancy aid, and helmet. You bring:
*   **Swimsuit or quick-drying underwear** (worn under the wetsuit)
*   **Old trainers** with reasonable grip — they'll get battered on the rocks
*   **A towel and warm clothes** for afterwards (you will be cold)
*   **Water and a snack** — you'll be hungry
*   **A sense of humour** — you'll probably get a face full of seaweed at some point

## Best Time to Go

**May to October**, with June-September being prime season.

| Month | Water Temp | Air Temp | Notes |
|-------|------------|----------|-------|
| May | 10-12°C | 12-16°C | Season starts, quieter, occasional cold snaps |
| June | 12-14°C | 14-18°C | **Excellent** — warming up, still pre-school-holidays |
| July-Aug | 14-16°C | 16-22°C | Peak season — book ahead, busiest |
| September | 14-15°C | 14-18°C | **Sweet spot** — warm water, fewer crowds |
| October | 12-14°C | 10-14°C | Season winds down, weather dependent |

Even in "peak summer" the water is bracing — that's part of the experience. Operators provide thick wetsuits year-round. [Read more about the best time for coasteering →](/answers/best-time-coasteering-wales)

## Safety and Fitness

**Is coasteering safe?** Yes, when done with accredited operators. Look for AALA (Adventure Activities Licensing Authority) certification. Wales has an excellent safety record — operators check conditions, tides, and swell before every session.

**Fitness required:** Moderate. You need to be able to swim confidently for short distances (no open water marathon swimming). Some climbing and scrambling is involved, but routes are adapted for different ability levels. Not suitable if you're pregnant or have serious back/neck issues.

**Minimum ages:** Most operators accept ages 8+, though some Anglesey operators require 10+. Children must be confident in water.

## The Smart Choice

If you're looking for an adrenaline-filled adventure that combines physical challenges with stunning coastal scenery, coasteering is one of the best things you can do in Wales.

- **Choose Pembrokeshire** for the classic experience and the biggest choice of operators
- **Choose Anglesey** for quieter sessions and dramatic sea caves  
- **Choose Gower** if you're coming from South Wales and want shorter travel
- **Start with a "classic" session** if you're nervous — the jumps are smaller and the route less exposed

For a less intense coastal experience, try [sea kayaking](/activities/kayaking). If you prefer freshwater and enclosed gorges, [gorge walking](/activities/gorge-walking) might be a better fit.
