# What is the best time of year for Gorge Walking in Wales?

## Quick Answer

The best time for gorge walking in Wales is generally between May and September. During these months, the water levels are typically lower and the weather is milder, making for safer and more enjoyable conditions in the gorges. However, even in summer, be prepared for cold water and the possibility of rain!

## Prime Time for Scrambling: Summer in the Gorges

Summer offers the most predictable conditions for gorge walking in Wales. Operators like TYF Adventure in Pembrokeshire run regular gorge scrambling trips in the Afon Ddu gorge near St Davids, with prices starting around £65 per person. The water is still bracing, but the air temperature is usually warm enough to make it a comfortable experience. You'll find similar options in Eryri (Snowdonia) with companies like Zip World offering gorge walking adventures near Betws-y-Coed, often incorporating zip lines and other thrilling elements; prices here can range from £75-£120 depending on the specific package.

Outside of the peak summer months, gorge walking is still possible, but be aware that water levels can rise dramatically after heavy rain, making some routes impassable or even dangerous. Always check the weather forecast and river levels before heading out, and only go with experienced guides who know the specific gorge well. Many operators will adjust their itineraries or cancel trips if conditions are unfavorable.

## Seasonal Gorge Walking Considerations

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Summer Gorge Walk | Warmer Temperatures | Moderate | Afon Ddu, Pembrokeshire |
| Spring Gorge Scramble | Fewer Crowds | Moderate to Challenging (water levels variable) | Eryri (Snowdonia) |
| Autumn Gorge Exploration | Stunning Scenery | Moderate to Challenging (water levels variable) | Brecon Beacons |

## Practical Tips

- Always wear appropriate footwear. Old trainers with good grip are ideal. Avoid sandals or flip-flops – you'll regret it!
- Bring a dry bag for your phone and any other valuables you want to keep safe. Even on a sunny day, you're guaranteed to get wet.
- Parking at popular gorge walking locations like Pontneddfechan in the Brecon Beacons can be limited, especially during peak season. Arrive early to secure a spot.
- Check the age and weight restrictions for gorge walking with your chosen operator before booking.
