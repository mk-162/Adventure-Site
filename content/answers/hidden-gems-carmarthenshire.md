# What are the hidden gems and secret spots in Carmarthenshire?

## Quick Answer

Carmarthenshire is brimming with secluded spots! Skip the crowds at the obvious beaches and head to the tranquil coves of Cwmfelin or the secluded sands of Marros. For a unique hike, explore the lesser-known trails in Brechfa Forest, or discover the Roman history hidden in the Dolaucothi Gold Mines.

## Secret Beaches and Coastal Walks

While Pendine Sands gets all the attention, Carmarthenshire's coastline hides some truly special spots. Cwmfelin, near Laugharne, offers a series of small, sandy coves perfect for a quiet afternoon. Access is via a slightly overgrown path, keeping the crowds away. Marros Sands, further west, is another gem – a long, sandy beach backed by dramatic cliffs. Be aware of the tides at Marros, as access can be limited at high tide. For a good walk, try the section of the Wales Coast Path between Llansteffan and Scott's Bay; the views across the Towy Estuary are stunning, and you'll likely have the path mostly to yourself. Check tide times before you set off!

## Inland Adventures: Forests and History

Beyond the coast, explore the Brechfa Forest, a haven for mountain biking and hiking. Ditch the popular trails and explore some of the lesser-used paths, especially around the Abergorlech area. You'll find waterfalls, ancient woodlands, and panoramic views. For a dose of history, venture to the National Trust's Dolaucothi Gold Mines near Pumpsaint. While the main tours are well-known, explore the surrounding woodlands and streams; you can often find remnants of Roman mining activity away from the crowds. Tours of the mines cost around £12 for adults.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Cwmfelin Cove | Seclusion & quiet beaches | Easy (access path a little overgrown) | Near Laugharne |
| Marros Sands | Dramatic coastal scenery | Moderate (tide dependent) | West Carmarthenshire |
| Brechfa Forest Trails | Mountain biking & hiking | Moderate to Challenging | Abergorlech Area |
| Dolaucothi Gold Mines (surrounding area) | History & woodland walks | Easy to Moderate | Pumpsaint |

## Practical Tips

- Park considerately when visiting smaller beaches like Cwmfelin; the lanes are narrow, and local residents need access.
- Download offline maps before heading into Brechfa Forest; mobile signal can be patchy.
- Check the National Trust website for Dolaucothi Gold Mines opening times and tour availability, especially during the off-season.
- Always wear appropriate footwear for coastal walks; the Wales Coast Path can be uneven and muddy in places.
