Think coasteering, kayaking, and surfing powered by ethical principles.\n\n# Preseli Venture: Eco-Adventure in Pembrokeshire\n\nIf you're heading to the Pembrokeshire coast and fancy getting properly stuck in, you'll be tripping over adventure operators. But before you book with just anyone, let me tell you about Preseli Venture. They've been doing this for years, and they do it *right*.\n\n## Who Are Preseli Venture?\n\nBased near the village of Mathry, a few miles inland from the rugged north Pembrokeshire coast, Preseli Venture is all about sustainable adventure. They've been running trips since the '80s – long before \"eco-tourism\" became a buzzword. This isn't some Johnny-come-lately trying to cash in on green credentials; it's a business built from the ground up with a focus on minimal impact and maximum enjoyment of this stunning corner of Wales.\n\nWhat that means in practice is smaller group sizes, experienced local guides who genuinely care about the environment, and a commitment to using locally sourced equipment and supplies where possible. They even generate their own electricity using solar panels. They're the sort of outfit you can feel good about giving your money to.\n\n## What Adventures Do They Offer?\n\nPreseli Venture's bread and butter is getting you wet and wild in the sea. They offer:\n\n*   **Coasteering:** Arguably their signature activity. Expect to scramble along the rocky coastline, jump off cliffs (optional, of course!), explore sea caves, and swim through the swell. Prices range from £55-£75, depending on the length of the session. They cater to all levels, from beginners to seasoned adrenaline junkies. I’ve seen grannies doing it! If you're looking for alternatives, TYF Adventure and Outer Reef Surf School also offer coasteering in the area.\n*   **Sea Kayaking:** Explore the coastline at a more leisurely pace, spotting seals, seabirds, and maybe even a dolphin if you're lucky. They run guided trips suitable for all skill levels, costing between £65-£95 depending on the length and location. If you prefer paddling in calmer waters, consider a kayaking trip on the River Wye near Symonds Yat, but remember it's a very different experience.\n*   **Surfing:** They offer lessons for beginners at nearby beaches. Pembrokeshire’s waves aren't always massive, but they're consistent enough to learn the basics. Expect to pay £55-£75 for a session. Alternatives such as TYF Adventure also offer surfing lessons.\n*   **Wild Swimming:** For those who enjoy a refreshing dip, Preseli Venture offers guided wild swimming experiences. Dive into secluded coves and experience the invigorating thrill of the Pembrokeshire coastline. The price for these swims typically ranges from £45-£65.\n*   **Boat Trip - Ramsey Island:** Step aboard for an unforgettable family boat trip around Ramsey Island, a haven for wildlife. Keep your eyes peeled for seals, seabirds, and maybe even a dolphin sighting! Prices for this adventure range from £45-£65, making it an affordable and exciting option for the whole family.\n\n## What Makes Them Different?\n\nBeyond the eco-friendly ethos, Preseli Venture stands out for a few key reasons:\n\n*   **Location, Location, Location:** Their proximity to the St Davids peninsula means they have access to some of the most dramatic and unspoilt coastline in Wales. They know the secret spots, the best jump-off points, and where to find the wildlife.\n*   **Small Groups:** They limit the size of their groups to ensure a more personal and immersive experience. You won't feel like you're just another number on a conveyor belt.\n*   **Experienced Guides:** The guides are not only highly qualified but also passionate about what they do. They'll share their knowledge of the local area, its history, and its wildlife.\n*   **Accommodation:** Preseli Venture has its own eco-lodge, which can sleep up to 24 people. It's a great option if you want to make a weekend of it or are traveling with a group. I stayed there last year and it's a proper, friendly place.\n*   **Commitment to Sustainability:** This isn't just lip service. They actively work to minimize their environmental impact and support local conservation efforts.\n\n## Who is Preseli Venture For?\n\n*   **Eco-conscious adventurers:** If you care about the environment and want to support a business that shares your values, Preseli Venture is a great choice.\n*   **Small groups:** If you prefer a more intimate and personal experience, their small group sizes will appeal.\n*   **All abilities:** They cater to a wide range of abilities, from beginners to experienced adventurers.\n*   **Families:** Their coasteering and kayaking trips are suitable for families with children (check age restrictions when booking).\n\n## Who Should Maybe Look Elsewhere?\n\n*   **Budget travelers:** While Preseli Venture's prices are competitive, you might find cheaper options elsewhere if you're on a very tight budget. Coasteering with Tenby Adventure, for example, starts slightly lower at £50. But you do often get what you pay for.\n*   **Those seeking extreme thrills:** While their activities are adventurous, they're not necessarily extreme. If you're looking for something truly hardcore, you might want to consider a climbing course in Snowdonia.\n*   **People who hate being cold:** The Pembrokeshire coast is beautiful, but it can also be exposed to the elements. Even in summer, the water can be chilly. They provide wetsuits, but if you really can't stand the cold, this might not be for you.\n\n## Practicalities\n\n*   **Location:** Near Mathry, Pembrokeshire. Use postcode SA62 5HB for your satnav.\n*   **Parking:** Free parking is available on-site.\n*   **Prices (2025/2026):** Coasteering £55-£75, Sea Kayaking £65-£95, Surfing £55-£75. Check their website for the most up-to-date prices and availability.\n*   **Booking:** Essential, especially during peak season (summer holidays). Book online through their website.\n*   **What to bring:** Swimsuit, towel, sunscreen, and a sense of adventure!\n*   **Travel time:** From Cardiff, expect a drive of around 2 hours 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on traffic. From Swansea, it's closer to 2 hours.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\nPreseli Venture offers an authentic and sustainable way to experience the stunning Pembrokeshire coast. Their commitment to the environment, experienced guides, and small group sizes make them a standout operator. If you're looking for an adventure that's both thrilling and ethical, give them a go. You won't regret it. And while you're in Pembrokeshire, consider checking out the Pembrokeshire Coast Path for some incredible [hiking](tag:hiking) opportunities.",
