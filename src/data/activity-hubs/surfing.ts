  // Introduction - compelling editorial (3-4 paragraphs)
  introduction: `Wales isn't where most people think of when they picture world-class surfing — and that's precisely its advantage. While Cornwall heaves with crowds and price-gouged car parks, Welsh breaks deliver the same North Atlantic power with a fraction of the lineups. From Pembrokeshire's reef-lined bays to the Gower's endless beach breaks and the raw exposure of Hell's Mouth on the Llŷn Peninsula, Wales offers genuinely uncrowded surf in stunning settings.

The Welsh surf scene has a proud, defiant history. In the 1960s, surfers were dismissed as "drug-taking hippies" and banned from beaches across the coast. Local communities fought back, forming protective groups that evolved into today's thriving surf clubs and schools. That grassroots spirit persists — Welsh surfing culture prioritizes wave-sharing, ocean connection, and local knowledge over commercialism. When Carwyn Williams, a Swansea coal miner's son, beat the reigning Australian World Champion in France in 1988, it put Welsh surfing on the map. Today, Wales has produced its first adaptive world champion in Llywelyn "Sponge" Williams.

The Welsh coast catches Atlantic swells from the southwest, with Pembrokeshire's exposed headlands pulling in the most consistent waves, while the Gower and Llŷn offer protection and variety. Water temperatures are cold year-round — you'll need a good wetsuit — but those chilly lineups mean empty peaks when it's firing. September to April is prime season: powerful groundswells from mid-Atlantic storms deliver overhead waves at spots like Freshwater West and Llangennith. Summer brings smaller, friendlier waves perfect for learning.

Here's the honest truth: Welsh surfing demands commitment. The water is cold, the weather is wild, and the best waves often arrive with howling storms. But when you paddle out at a deserted Pembrokeshire reef, drop into a clean Atlantic wall, and ride it with nothing but seabirds for company — you'll understand why Welsh surfers never leave.`,

  // FAQs
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "When is the best time to surf in Wales?",
      answer: "September to November offers the ideal combination of consistent Atlantic swells, cleaner offshore winds, and relatively warm water (12-16°C). Winter (December-February) brings the biggest waves but harsh conditions. Summer is best for beginners — smaller, gentler waves — but can be flat for extended periods.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need my own wetsuit and board?",
      answer: "No — every major surf beach has hire options and surf schools provide all equipment. Wetsuit hire is typically £10-15/day, board hire £15-25/day. Lessons (£30-45) include all gear. That said, your own well-fitted wetsuit makes a massive difference to comfort.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Welsh surf water cold?",
      answer: "Yes. Water temperature ranges from 8°C in winter to 17°C at summer peak. You'll need a 4/3mm wetsuit for most of the year, with a 5/4mm plus boots, gloves, and hood for winter. A good wetsuit is non-negotiable — cold water kills sessions faster than anything else.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best spot for beginners?",
      answer: "Caswell Bay (Gower) and Whitesands Bay (Pembrokeshire) offer sheltered, gentle waves ideal for first-timers. Llangennith is excellent when small but can get powerful. Book a lesson — qualified instruction accelerates learning dramatically and keeps you safe.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is surfing in Wales dangerous?",
      answer: "Like all ocean activities, there are risks. Rip currents are the main hazard — learn to identify and escape them (swim parallel to shore, not against). Always check conditions, tell someone your plans, and don't surf alone at remote breaks. Respect your limits and you'll be fine.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where should I stay for a surf trip?",
      answer: "Llangennith has Hillend Camping directly behind the beach — perfect for dawn patrols. St Davids is ideal for Pembrokeshire (Whitesands, Freshwater West). For Porthcawl, stay in the town itself. Abersoch is the base for Llŷn Peninsula. All regions have holiday cottages, campsites, and B&Bs.",
    },
    {
      question: "How crowded are Welsh lineups?",
      answer: "Significantly less crowded than Cornwall. Summer weekends at Llangennith and Freshwater West can get busy, but you'll rarely experience the drop-in culture of English hotspots. Weekdays, autumn, winter, and lesser-known breaks offer empty peaks.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I surf all year round?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Winter offers the most consistent, powerful waves for experienced surfers with proper kit. Spring and autumn are prime season. Summer suits beginners. The Welsh surfing community surfs year-round — it's about gear, attitude, and knowing your limits.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the etiquette in the lineup?",
      answer: "The surfer closest to the peak (breaking part of the wave) has right of way — don't drop in. Wait your turn, don't paddle around others to get priority, communicate if unclear. Smile, share waves, respect locals, and apologise for mistakes. Arseholes get remembered.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there competitions I can watch or enter?",
      answer: "The Welsh National Surfing Championships run annually (usually split between Freshwater West and Llantwit Major). Open categories let anyone enter. The Welsh Surfing Federation runs the Junior Championships and regional events. Check wsf.wales for the calendar.",
    },
