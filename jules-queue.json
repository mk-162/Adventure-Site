Summary: Itinerary stops like Bounce Below and Velocity 2 are showing wrong images (lakes, dogs). Research each branded Welsh attraction, source verified Welsh images from approved sources (Visit Wales, Wikimedia, Geograph, Flickr CC), vision-verify each image shows the correct attraction, download to /public/images/attractions/, create src/data/attraction-images.ts mapping, and update src/lib/activity-images.ts to check attractions before falling back to activity type. Key attractions: Bounce Below (underground trampolines), Velocity 2 (quarry zip line), Zip World Fforest Coaster, Go Ape Forest of Dean, Surf Snowdonia, Dan yr Ogof Caves.
