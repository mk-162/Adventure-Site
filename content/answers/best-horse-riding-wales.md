# Where's the Best Horse Riding in Wales?

The Brecon Beacons and Snowdonia foothills offer the best horse riding in Wales — huge open moorland, mountain trails with jaw-dropping views, and operators who actually know the terrain.

## Why Wales is Brilliant for Riding

Wales has something most English riding centres don't: genuine wilderness. You're not trotting around a paddock or following a tarmac bridleway — you're riding across open mountain, through river crossings, and along beaches that stretch for miles.

The variety is what makes it special. In a single weekend you could canter along the vast sands at Llansteffan in [Carmarthenshire](/carmarthenshire), ride through ancient oak woodland in [Mid Wales](/mid-wales), or tackle mountain paths in [Snowdonia](/snowdonia) with views all the way to Anglesey.

### Best Regions for Horse Riding

**Brecon Beacons & Black Mountains** — The classic. Miles of open common land and bridleways crossing the Beacons. Several well-established trekking centres offer everything from hour-long hacks to full-day mountain rides. Expect to pay £35–£50 per hour, with full-day treks around £120–£150. The terrain suits confident beginners and above.

**Snowdonia Foothills** — More dramatic scenery, with rides that take in lakes, forests, and moorland. The going can be rougher here, so operators tend to cater to riders with some experience. Worth it for the views alone.

**Pembrokeshire Coast** — Beach rides are the draw. Several operators run sessions along the wide sands at Newgale and Druidston. There's nothing quite like galloping along a Welsh beach at low tide. Beach rides typically cost £45–£65 per session.

**Gower Peninsula** — Shorter rides but stunning coastline. Good for families and less experienced riders who want a taste of beach riding without a full-day commitment.

### What to Know Before You Book

Most Welsh trekking centres cater to beginners, but be honest about your experience level — the terrain can be genuinely challenging. Weight limits typically apply (usually around 14–15 stone). Book well ahead in summer, especially for beach rides. Bring layers — you'll be exposed on the hills and it's always windier than you expect.

Welsh riding centres generally provide hard hats and all tack. Wear long trousers and boots with a small heel. Wellies won't cut it.
