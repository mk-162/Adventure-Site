# Quirky & Unique Accommodation Research

## The Brief
Find the most INTERESTING and UNUSUAL places to stay - not "best hotels". We want content that makes people say "I need to stay there!"

## What We're Looking For

### Unique Structures
- Treehouses, elevated cabins
- Converted lighthouses, signal boxes, water towers
- Shepherd's huts, gypsy caravans, vintage airstreams
- Glass-walled cabins with mountain/sea views
- Geodesic domes, bubble tents
- Converted boats, houseboats

### Historic & Characterful
- Old hunting lodges, gamekeepers' cottages
- Converted barns, mills, chapels
- Castle towers, follies
- Railway carriages, stations
- Fishermen's huts, beach cottages

### Adventure-Adjacent
- Mountain bothies with epic views
- Clifftop pods overlooking the sea
- Forest hideaways
- Lakeside cabins
- Beachfront glamping

### Ultra-Modern
- Architect-designed eco cabins
- Off-grid luxury with hot tubs
- Scandinavian-style minimal retreats

## For Each Property Capture
- Name and exact location (coordinates)
- What makes it unique (the hook)
- Hero images (source URLs from their site/Airbnb)
- Price range per night
- Sleeps how many
- Adventure activities nearby
- Booking link (direct or Airbnb/Canopy&Stars/etc)
- One-liner description that sells it

## Output Format
`data/accommodation/quirky/{region}.json`

## Quality Bar
- Must have great photos available
- Must be genuinely interesting (not just "nice cottage")
- Must be bookable (real listings)
- Aim for 10-15 properties per region
