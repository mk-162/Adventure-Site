# What are the hidden gems and secret spots in Mid Wales?

## Quick Answer

Mid Wales is brimming with secluded escapes! Skip the crowds at Pen y Fan and head to the Radnor Forest for wild, empty trails. For a unique adventure, try canyoning with Gaia Adventures in the Brecon Beacons, exploring gorges few others see.

## Uncover the Radnor Forest

Forget the well-trodden paths of Snowdonia (Eryri); the Radnor Forest offers a truly solitary hiking experience. This isn't a forest in the traditional sense, but rather a sprawling upland area with diverse terrain, from heather-clad hills to hidden valleys. Try the Water-break-its-neck waterfall trail near New Radnor for a stunning, less-visited spot. Be aware that navigation can be challenging, especially in poor weather, so bring a map and compass (or a reliable GPS device) and be prepared for changeable conditions. Parking is free at the designated trailhead.

For a longer trek, consider the Radnor Ring, a 55-mile circular route. It's best tackled over 3-4 days, camping wild (with permission from landowners) or staying in small B&Bs along the way. You'll likely encounter more sheep than people!

## Canyoning in the Brecon Beacons

While the Brecon Beacons National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog) is popular, few venture into its hidden canyons. Canyoning, also known as gorge walking, involves navigating a river gorge by swimming, scrambling, and abseiling. Gaia Adventures, based in Brecon, offers guided canyoning trips suitable for beginners, with prices ranging from £75-£120 per person, depending on the length and difficulty of the route.

Expect to get wet and experience a thrilling mix of adrenaline and natural beauty. Some canyons feature waterfalls you'll descend, while others offer natural slides and pools for swimming. Trips typically run from April to October, with wetsuits provided. Be prepared for a full day of activity and a moderate level of fitness is required.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Radnor Forest Hiking | Solitude and challenging navigation | Moderate to Strenuous | Near New Radnor |
| Gaia Adventures Canyoning | Adrenaline junkies and water lovers | Beginner to Intermediate | Brecon Beacons |

## Practical Tips

- Download offline maps before heading into remote areas like the Radnor Forest, as phone signal can be patchy.
- Pack insect repellent, especially during the summer months, as midges can be a nuisance in wooded areas and near water.
- Book canyoning trips in advance, particularly during peak season (July-August), to avoid disappointment.
- Check the weather forecast before setting out on any outdoor adventure and be prepared for sudden changes.
