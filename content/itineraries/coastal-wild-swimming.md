# Coastal Wild Swimming

## Who This Trip Is For

This trip is for adventurous souls who love the feeling of cold water on their skin and aren't afraid of a bit of a hike. It suits adults in good shape who are comfortable swimming in the sea, even if it's choppy. This isn't a relaxing beach holiday; it's for those who want to earn their swims with some coastal path walking. Families with teenagers could enjoy it, but little ones might find the distances too challenging and the water too cold. If you prefer your holidays with guaranteed sunshine and a pool, this one's not for you.

## The Route Logic

Pembrokeshire's coastline is stunning, but it's also long! This itinerary focuses on the northern section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, near St. Davids, known for its dramatic cliffs and clear waters. It's structured to minimize driving each day while maximizing swim opportunities. We start further North and work our way down to allow you to do any boat trips at the end. Traffic can be brutal in peak season, so we're aiming to base ourselves centrally.

## Day 1: North Coast Exploration

### The Plan

We're starting with a shorter walk to ease you into the coastal path and get you acclimatized to the water temperature. The focus is on finding a beautiful, sheltered spot for your first swim.

**Morning:** Swim at Blue Lagoon, Abereiddi
- What to expect: A former slate quarry filled with turquoise seawater. It's popular, but the high slate walls provide shelter from the wind. The jump is optional, but most people do it!
- Suitability: Good swimmers only. The entry/exit can be tricky with slippery rocks, and the water is deep. Kids might need a confidence boost (and maybe a life jacket).

**Afternoon:** Hike from Abereiddi to Porthgain (approx 2 miles).
- This is a relatively easy, flat section of the coastal path. Porthgain is a charming harbor village with a pub where you can refuel. You could also take a quick dip in the harbor.

**Base for the night:** St Davids area
- Why here: St Davids is a central hub with easy access to both the northern and southern sections of the coast. It also has a good selection of accommodation options.

## Day 2: Ramsey Island Views & Secret Coves

### The Plan

Today is about exploring the dramatic coastline around St. Davids Head. We'll hike to a hidden cove for a swim, offering stunning views of Ramsey Island.

**Morning:** Hike from Whitesands Bay to Porthmelgan (approx 4 miles).
- What to expect: This is a more challenging hike than yesterday, with some steep ascents and descents. Porthmelgan is a beautiful, secluded cove, perfect for a swim. The views of Ramsey Island are incredible.
- Suitability: You'll need decent hiking boots and a reasonable level of fitness. The scramble down to the beach at Porthmelgan can be tricky, especially when wet.

**Afternoon:** Option 1: Relax on Whitesands Beach. Option 2: Book the Ramsey Island Boat Trip with Preseli Venture.
- If the weather is good, a boat trip around Ramsey Island is a must. You'll see seals, seabirds, and maybe even dolphins. Book in advance, especially in summer.

**Base for the night:** St Davids area
- Why here: Staying put saves you the hassle of packing up and moving.

## Day 3: Southern Shores and Optional Adventure

### The Plan

Today, we head south to explore some different coastal scenery. You have the option of incorporating a guided activity if you want to up the adrenaline.

**Morning:** Drive to Broad Haven South (approx 45 minutes from St Davids).
- What to expect: A beautiful sandy beach backed by dunes. Swim out to Church Rock for some fun. Parking can be a nightmare here in peak season, so arrive early (before 10 am).
- Suitability: This is a more accessible swim than the previous days, but still be aware of currents and tides.

**Afternoon:** Choose your adventure!
- Option 1: Relax on Broad Haven South or nearby Barafundle Bay (voted one of the UK's best beaches).
- Option 2: Book a Coasteering session with Activity Pembrokeshire or TYF Adventure. (See activity list).

**Departure:** Head home, sun-kissed and salty!

## Know Before You Go

### Weather Reality

Pembrokeshire weather is notoriously unpredictable. Sunshine and showers can occur within minutes of each other. The wind is a major factor, as it can make swimming conditions dangerous. Check the forecast carefully before you go, and be prepared to adjust your plans if necessary. Day 2 is particularly weather-dependent due to the exposed coastline.

### Traffic & Timing

Traffic along the A487 can be very heavy in summer, especially on weekends. Allow plenty of extra time for your journey. The roads around St Davids are narrow and winding. Parking at popular beaches like Whitesands and Broad Haven South is limited, so arrive early or be prepared to walk.

### Fitness Check

"Moderate" means you need to be comfortable walking for several hours at a time, sometimes over uneven terrain and steep hills. You should also be a confident swimmer in open water and able to cope with cold water temperatures (even in summer). If you're unsure, start with shorter walks and swims to build your fitness.

### Best Time of Year

June and September are the best months for this trip. The weather is generally good, the crowds are smaller, and the water temperature is slightly warmer. July and August are the busiest (and most expensive) months. Avoid visiting in winter, as many businesses are closed and the weather can be harsh.
