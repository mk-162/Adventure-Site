  "introduction": "Pembrokeshire's 186-mile coast is one of the finest sea kayaking destinations in the British Isles. The combination of dramatic cliffs, sea caves, natural arches, offshore islands, and abundant marine wildlife creates an experience that's hard to match anywhere in the UK.\n\nThe coastline ranges from sheltered harbours perfect for beginners to exposed headlands that demand serious open-water skills. Grey seals are practically guaranteed, porpoises are common, and puffin season (April-July) on Skomer and Skokholm is magical.\n\nMost spots can be paddled independently if you have your own boat and experience, but guided trips are available everywhere and are strongly recommended for beginners. Water temperature is 8-17°C, so a wetsuit or drysuit is essential year-round. Tides are significant — some spots become dangerous or inaccessible at certain states of tide.",
  "rankingCriteria": "We've paddled all of these spots in varying conditions. Rankings combine scenic quality, wildlife encounters, sea cave and feature richness, accessibility, and the overall paddling experience. We favour spots that deliver genuine 'wow moments' from the water.",
