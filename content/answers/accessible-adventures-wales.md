## Planning an Accessible Trip

### Questions to Ask Operators

1. **What specific equipment do you have?** (Hoists, adaptive equipment, beach wheelchairs)
2. **What surfaces will we encounter?** (Tarmac, gravel, grass, sand)
3. **Are there accessible toilets on site?**
4. **Can you accommodate my specific needs?** (Be specific about your requirements)
5. **What happens if conditions change?** (Weather, tide, etc.)

### General Tips

- **Book ahead** — Accessible equipment is limited
- **Call, don't just email** — Easier to explain specific needs
- **Arrive early** — More time to set up, adjust equipment
- **Be specific** — "I use a manual wheelchair and can transfer independently" is more useful than "I'm disabled"
- **Check recent reviews** — Accessibility changes; recent visitors give current picture

### Accommodation

Many hotels and B&Bs have accessible rooms — use:
- **VisitWales accessibility filter**
- **Direct contact** to confirm specifics (grab rails, roll-in shower, etc.)
- **Disabled Holidays** specialist booking site

**Accessible self-catering:**

## The Honest Picture

**What's good:**

- Some world-class accessible experiences exist
- Natural beauty is viewable from many accessible points

**What's challenging:**

**The mindset:**
With planning and the right operator, genuine adventure is possible. It may look different from non-disabled adventure, but the thrill, the scenery, and the achievement are equally real.
