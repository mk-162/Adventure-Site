# What Are the Best Beaches in Pembrokeshire?

## Quick Answer

Pembrokeshire has some of Britain's finest beaches — over 50 to choose from, many rivalling Mediterranean destinations for water clarity. **Barafundle Bay** is the poster child (regularly voted UK's best), but **Freshwater West** offers better surf, **Whitesands** combines family-friendliness with waves, and **Marloes Sands** delivers solitude. Each beach has different strengths depending on what you're after.

## Top 10 Pembrokeshire Beaches

### 1. Barafundle Bay ⭐
*The famous one — worth the walk*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Best for** | Wild swimming, photography, couples |
| **Access** | 20-minute walk from Stackpole Quay car park |
| **Parking** | £4-6/day at Stackpole Quay (NT) |
| **Facilities** | None at beach — toilets at car park |
| **Dog restrictions** | Allowed year-round |
| **Blue Flag** | No (Green Coast Award — cleaner than Blue Flag!) |

**The detail:** Golden sand framed by dunes and cliffs. No facilities means no crowds relative to its fame. The walk-in deters casual visitors, keeping it special. Crystal-clear turquoise water on calm days. Arrive early in summer or the car park fills.

**Insider tip:** Continue walking to **Broad Haven South** for a connected beach with caves, or head to **Stackpole Quay** for rock pooling and the Boathouse Tearoom.
