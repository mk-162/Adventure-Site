# Where are the best Coasteering locations in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Wales boasts some incredible coasteering locations! For adrenaline junkies, Pembrokeshire's jagged coastline around St. Davids is a must, offering challenging jumps and swims. For something a bit tamer, but equally beautiful, the Gower Peninsula provides stunning scenery and gentler routes, perfect for families and beginners.

## Pembrokeshire: The Coasteering Epicenter

Pembrokeshire is arguably the best place in Wales for coasteering, with its dramatic cliffs, clear waters, and abundance of marine life. St. Davids Head is a particularly popular spot, offering a range of routes suitable for different abilities. TYF Adventure, based in St. Davids, are seasoned experts and offer coasteering trips from around £55 per person. They know all the secret spots and prioritize safety without compromising on the thrill. Expect exhilarating jumps (optional, of course!), swims through narrow gullies, and scrambles over wave-battered rocks. The coastline here is exposed, so be prepared for some swell, especially during the autumn and winter months.

Another Pembrokeshire gem is the Blue Lagoon near Abereiddy. This flooded quarry provides a unique coasteering experience with deep, turquoise water and varying jump heights. Celtic Quest Coasteering operates here and offers trips tailored to families and less experienced coasteerers. Expect to pay around £50 per person. Bear in mind that the Blue Lagoon can get very busy during peak season (July/August), so booking in advance is essential.

## Gower Peninsula: Coasteering with a View

The Gower Peninsula offers a more relaxed coasteering experience compared to the rugged Pembrokeshire coast. The scenery is still spectacular, with golden sandy beaches and limestone cliffs, but the routes tend to be less challenging, making it ideal for families and beginners. Langland Bay and Caswell Bay are popular starting points, with several smaller coves and gullies to explore.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| St. Davids Head | Adrenaline junkies | Challenging | Pembrokeshire |
| Blue Lagoon | Unique scenery | Moderate | Pembrokeshire |
| Langland Bay | Families | Easy | Gower Peninsula |

## Practical Tips

- Check the tide times before you go! Coasteering is best done at low tide to maximize the amount of accessible coastline and avoid dangerous currents. Many operators will only run trips at specific tide times.
- Wear appropriate footwear. Old trainers or wetsuit boots with good grip are essential. Avoid sandals or bare feet, as the rocks can be sharp and slippery.
- Book in advance, especially during peak season. Popular operators like TYF Adventure and Celtic Quest Coasteering get booked up quickly.
- Be aware of the conditions. The Welsh coast can be unpredictable, so be prepared for changes in weather and sea state. Listen to your guide and follow their instructions carefully.
