# Where are the best Hiking locations in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Wales boasts incredible hiking for all levels. For challenging summit hikes, head to Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park, especially Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) itself, or try the Brecon Beacons for stunning views. For coastal walks, the Pembrokeshire Coast Path offers breathtaking scenery and diverse terrain.

## Summit Hikes in Eryri (Snowdonia)

Eryri is a haven for serious hikers. Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) offers several routes to the summit, ranging from the relatively easy Llanberis Path to the challenging Crib Goch scramble. Expect crowds, especially during peak season (summer), and be prepared for changeable weather. A return trip on the Llanberis Path will take around 5-6 hours. Consider booking a guided hike with a local operator like Snowdonia Mountain Guides for safety and insider knowledge; prices range from £60-£100 per person. For a less crowded but equally rewarding experience, try Tryfan, known for its iconic knife-edge ridge.

Beyond Yr Wyddfa, explore the Glyderau range, including Glyder Fawr and Glyder Fach, for rugged terrain and stunning views. Be aware that these hikes involve some scrambling and are not suitable for beginners. The Snowdonia National Park Authority website offers detailed trail maps and safety advice. Remember that parking in Eryri can be limited, especially during peak season; arrive early or use the park-and-ride services.

## Coastal Hiking on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path

The Pembrokeshire Coast Path offers 186 miles of stunning coastal scenery, from dramatic cliffs to sandy beaches. You can tackle it in sections, with highlights including the stretch from St Davids to Whitesands Bay, known for its rugged beauty and abundant wildlife. Expect to see seals, seabirds, and maybe even dolphins. Another popular section is the walk around Stackpole Head, famous for its iconic rock formations like the Green Bridge of Wales.

Several companies offer guided walks and multi-day hiking tours along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, such as Celtic Trails. Prices for guided day hikes range from £40-£70 per person. The path is generally well-maintained, but some sections can be challenging, with steep ascents and descents. Check tide times before setting out, as some beaches are impassable at high tide. Spring and autumn offer the best weather for hiking, with fewer crowds than summer.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) via Llanberis Path | First-time summit hikers | Moderate | Eryri (Snowdonia) |
| Tryfan | Experienced scramblers | Challenging | Eryri (Snowdonia) |
| Pembrokeshire Coast Path (St Davids to Whitesands) | Coastal scenery & wildlife | Moderate | Pembrokeshire |
| Pen y Fan | Brecon Beacons beginner summit | Easy/Moderate | Brecon Beacons |

## Practical Tips

- Download offline maps before you go, as mobile signal can be patchy in remote areas.
- Pack for all weather conditions, even in summer. The Welsh mountains are notorious for sudden changes in weather.
- Park at Pont Pen-y-bont for easy access to trails around Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons, avoiding the busier Storey Arms car park.
- Tell someone your planned route and expected return time, especially if hiking solo.
