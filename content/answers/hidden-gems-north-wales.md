# What are the hidden gems and secret spots in North Wales?

## Quick Answer

North Wales is brimming with off-the-beaten-path adventures! Skip the Snowdon summit queue and explore the stunning Nantlle Ridge, a challenging but rewarding scramble. For coastal serenity, discover the secluded Porth Iago beach on the Llŷn Peninsula, or delve into the Sygun Copper Mine near Beddgelert for a unique underground experience.

## Uncrowded Hikes and Scrambles

Eryri (Snowdonia) is popular for a reason, but escape the crowds by tackling the Nantlle Ridge. This horseshoe route offers incredible views and exposed scrambling, a proper challenge for experienced hikers. It's free to access, but be prepared for a full day out and check weather conditions as it can be treacherous in poor visibility. Alternatively, head to Moel Famau in the Clwydian Range. While popular with locals, it's far less crowded than Snowdon and offers panoramic views from the Jubilee Tower at the summit. Parking at the Bwlch Penbarras car park costs around £3 for the day. For a guided experience, consider booking a hike with a local operator like RAW Adventures based in Llanberis; prices vary depending on the route and group size.

For a more relaxed walk, explore the Aber Falls (Rhaeadr Fawr) near Abergwyngregyn. The well-maintained path leads to a spectacular waterfall cascading down the mountainside. It's easily accessible and suitable for families, but can get busy during peak season. Parking costs around £5.

## Secret Beaches and Coastal Delights

North Wales boasts a stunning coastline, and while beaches like Llandudno are well-known, there are plenty of hidden gems to discover. Porth Iago on the Llŷn Peninsula is a small, sandy cove with crystal-clear waters, perfect for swimming and sunbathing. Access is via a farm track, and there's a small parking fee (around £2). Another fantastic option is Traeth Llydan (Broad Beach) near Lligwy Bay on Anglesey. This vast expanse of sand is ideal for long walks and watersports, and is much quieter than the more popular beaches on the island.

For a unique coastal experience, try coasteering with an operator like TYF Adventure in Holyhead. They'll guide you along the rocky coastline, scrambling, swimming, and jumping into the sea. Prices start from around £65 per person.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Nantlle Ridge | Experienced hikers seeking a challenge | Strenuous | Near Penygroes |
| Porth Iago | Secluded swimming and sunbathing | Easy | Llŷn Peninsula |
| Sygun Copper Mine | History buffs and families | Moderate | Near Beddgelert |
| Traeth Llydan | Long walks and watersports | Easy | Anglesey |

## Practical Tips

- Check tide times before visiting coastal areas, especially if you plan to explore rock pools or hidden coves.
- Many of the smaller beaches have limited parking, so arrive early, especially during the summer months.
- The weather in North Wales can be unpredictable, so be prepared for all conditions, even on sunny days. Pack layers, waterproofs, and sturdy footwear.
- Book activities like coasteering or guided hikes in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid disappointment.
