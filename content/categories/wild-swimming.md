You can expect expert guidance on swimming techniques, water safety, and local wildlife. Most operators provide wetsuits and buoyancy aids, but it's always best to check beforehand.

### Costs

The cost of wild swimming experiences in Wales typically ranges from £45 to £65 per person, depending on the duration, location, and what's included. Factors that affect the cost include whether wetsuit hire is included, the level of guidance provided, and if transport to the swimming location is included.

## Best Time of Year

The best time of year for wild swimming in Wales is generally from May to September, when the water temperatures are at their warmest. However, even during these months, the water can still be cool, so a wetsuit is often recommended.
