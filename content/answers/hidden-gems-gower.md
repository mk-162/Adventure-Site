# What are the hidden gems and secret spots in Gower Peninsula?

## Quick Answer

Gower isn't just Rhossili Bay! For secluded beaches, head to Pwlldu Bay, a pebble beach accessible via the coast path from Bishopston. Explore the ancient woodland of Parc le Breos, keeping an eye out for Arthur's Stone, a Neolithic burial chamber. For a unique experience, try foraging with Coastal Foraging, learning about edible plants along the coastline.

## Discovering Secret Beaches and Coastal Walks

Beyond the famous Rhossili, Gower hides some incredible, quieter coastal spots. Pwlldu Bay, near Bishopston, is a wonderfully secluded pebble beach backed by steep cliffs. It's a bit of a walk down from the village (around 30 minutes via the coast path), which keeps the crowds away. Note that there are no facilities at Pwlldu, so pack accordingly. Another gem is Brandy Cove, a small, sandy beach near Caswell, steeped in smuggling history. It's much smaller than Caswell and gets cut off at high tide, so check tide times before you go. For a longer walk, try the section of the Wales Coast Path between Port Eynon and Overton. It offers stunning views across to Worm's Head and passes through some truly wild and remote coastline. This section can be challenging in places, with steep climbs and uneven terrain, so wear appropriate footwear.

For a different perspective, consider a guided kayak tour with Gower Coast Adventures from Oxwich Bay. They often explore hidden coves and sea caves inaccessible by foot. Prices start around £45 per person for a half-day trip. Be aware that sea conditions in Gower can change rapidly, so tours are weather-dependent.

## Inland Exploration: Woods, Caves, and Standing Stones

Gower isn't just about the coast; its inland areas are equally rewarding. Parc le Breos, near Penmaen, is an ancient woodland with marked trails and a fascinating history. Keep an eye out for Arthur's Stone, a Neolithic burial chamber perched on a hilltop, offering panoramic views. The woods are particularly beautiful in spring when the bluebells are in bloom. Further west, near Reynoldston, you'll find the lesser-known Paviland Cave (also known as Goat's Hole Cave), where the Red Lady of Paviland, a 33,000-year-old human skeleton, was discovered. While you can't enter the cave (it's on private land), it's worth seeing from the outside and imagining its historical significance.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Pwlldu Bay | Seclusion & a challenging walk | Moderate | Near Bishopston |
| Brandy Cove | A quick escape and history buffs | Easy | Near Caswell |
| Wales Coast Path (Port Eynon to Overton) | Dramatic views & a longer hike | Challenging | West Gower |
| Parc le Breos | Woodland walks & history | Easy | Near Penmaen |

## Practical Tips

- Check tide times! Many of Gower's hidden beaches disappear at high tide. The Gower Coast Adventures website has a useful tide chart.
- Parking can be a nightmare in peak season (especially summer weekends). Arrive early or consider using the park-and-ride service from Swansea.
- Bring cash! Many of the smaller cafes and shops in Gower don't accept card payments.
- Be prepared for all types of weather. Gower's climate can be unpredictable, even in summer. Pack layers and waterproofs.
