This not-for-profit event supports local artists and suppliers, with all proceeds going back into the community. The festival transforms Cardigan's centre with food stalls, live entertainment on the main stage, and activities celebrating the town's connection to the River Teifi. Run by Menter Aberteifi with support from Ceredigion County Council and Food & Drink Wales, this family-friendly event offers free entry for under-18s and a complimentary park and ride service.",
