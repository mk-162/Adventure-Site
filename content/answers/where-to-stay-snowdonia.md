# Where to Stay in Snowdonia?

## Quick Answer

Snowdonia offers diverse accommodation options catering to different priorities. For adventure activities like Zip World and mountain biking, consider Betws-y-Coed or Blaenau Ffestiniog. If hiking Snowdon is your focus, Llanberis or a quieter village like Beddgelert provide excellent access to various trails and stunning scenery.

## The Detail

Snowdonia's villages each offer a unique base for exploring the region:

*   **Llanberis:** This village sits at the foot of Snowdon and is the starting point for the popular Llanberis Path. It offers a good range of hotels, B&Bs, and self-catering options. It's ideal for those primarily focused on hiking Snowdon and other nearby peaks. It can get very busy during peak season. Good for families with easy access to amenities.

*   **Betws-y-Coed:** Known as the "Gateway to Snowdonia," Betws-y-Coed is a charming village with a wider selection of shops and restaurants. It's centrally located for exploring both the northern and southern parts of the park, and close to Zip World Fforest Coaster. Accommodation ranges from luxury hotels to cozy guesthouses. A great all-rounder, but can feel a bit touristy.

*   **Blaenau Ffestiniog:** A former slate mining town, Blaenau Ffestiniog is now a hub for adventure activities like Zip World Velocity 2 and Bounce Below. Accommodation here is generally more budget-friendly, with a focus on guesthouses and self-catering. It's a good choice if you're prioritizing adrenaline-fueled activities. This location is further from the main hiking trails on Snowdon.

*   **Beddgelert:** This picturesque village offers a more tranquil experience. Situated in a beautiful valley, it's ideal for those seeking peace and quiet alongside access to walking trails. Accommodation tends to be in the form of smaller, independent B&Bs and holiday cottages. Great for a relaxing escape and exploring the surrounding valleys and forests.

*   **For Mountain Bikers:** If Downhill MTB at Antur Stiniog is your focus, again Blaenau Ffestiniog is the obvious choice. For the trails around Betws-y-Coed (MinorTaur and Temtiwr), then staying in or near Betws-y-Coed minimizes travel time.

Consider factors like proximity to your chosen activities, budget, and preferred style of accommodation when making your decision. Booking in advance is highly recommended, especially during peak season.

## The Smart Choice

If I were planning a trip primarily focused on hiking Snowdon and general sightseeing, I'd choose a B&B in Llanberis for its immediate access to the mountain. However, for a more balanced adventure including mountain biking and Zip World, I'd opt for a self-catering cottage near Betws-y-Coed to have more flexibility. For budget-conscious travellers focused on Zip World, Blaenau Ffestiniog is the best bet.
