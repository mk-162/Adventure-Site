  "description": "One of Wales's most historic food events, the Conwy Honey Fair dates back 700 years to a Royal Charter granted by Edward I. Held annually in Conwy's medieval walled town, this charming street fair sees local beekeepers sell approximately a tonne of honey by lunchtime. Browse stalls offering local honey, beeswax candles, honey soaps, and bee-related crafts alongside plant sellers and home produce. Organised by Conwy Beekeepers since 1990, the fair has been revived as a major event celebrating the ancient connection between this UNESCO World Heritage town and beekeeping. All proceeds support Bees for Development charity. Local beekeepers showcase their finest honeys alongside demonstrations of traditional beekeeping techniques.",
