# Where are the best Zip Lining locations in Wales?

## Quick Answer

For the ultimate zip-lining experience in Wales, head straight to Zip World. They have several locations, including Penrhyn Quarry in Bethesda for Velocity 2, the fastest zip line in the world, and Llechwedd Slate Caverns in Blaenau Ffestiniog for Titan 2, the largest zip zone in Europe. For a more natural setting, consider the zip lines at Go Ape in Margam Park, near Port Talbot.

## Zip World: The Zip Line Mecca of Wales

Zip World dominates the zip-lining scene in Wales, and for good reason. Their Penrhyn Quarry location is home to Velocity 2, where you can reach speeds of over 100 mph while soaring over a stunning quarry lake. Prices start from around £99 per person. At their Llechwedd site, Titan 2 offers a different kind of thrill – a series of zip lines that take you deep into the historic slate caverns. This is a great option if the weather isn't perfect, as much of the experience is underground. Expect to pay around £75 per person. Zip World also has a site at Betws-y-Coed, Zip World Fforest, which has a variety of zip lines and other adventure activities suitable for families.

Beyond the headline attractions, Zip World also offers other unique experiences like Bounce Below, giant trampolines in a cavern, and Caverns, an underground adventure course. Booking in advance is essential, especially during peak season (summer and school holidays). Be aware that Velocity 2 has height and weight restrictions, so check these before you book.

## Go Ape: Tree Top Adventures with a Zip Line Finish

If you're looking for a more integrated woodland experience that includes zip lines, Go Ape at Margam Park is a good option. While not solely focused on zip lines, their tree-top adventure courses culminate in exhilarating zip line rides through the forest canopy. This is a great choice for families and those who enjoy a mix of climbing and zip-lining. Prices typically range from £20-£30 per person, depending on the course. Margam Park itself is worth exploring, with a castle, gardens, and wild deer roaming freely.

## Practical Tips
