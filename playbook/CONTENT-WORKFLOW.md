# Content Creation Workflow

*How research becomes quality pages*

---

## The Principle

> Jules gathers the ingredients. We cook the meal.

The database is raw research. Pages are crafted content. The gap between them is where quality happens.

## Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Curation
Before a spot gets a page, ask:

- [ ] Would someone travel specifically for this?
- [ ] Do we have something useful to say beyond basic facts?
- [ ] Is there genuine value we can add?
- [ ] Does this spot deserve attention, or just exist?

**If no → stays in database, not published**

### Gate 2: Writing
Before content is written, ensure:

- [ ] Writer has access to all research (not just CSV row)
- [ ] Multiple sources consulted, not just one
- [ ] Images reviewed and best selected
- [ ] Local knowledge incorporated where possible

**Template ≠ Quality.** Every page needs human thought.

### Gate 3: Quality Check
Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] Would I send this link to a friend planning a trip?
- [ ] Does it say something TripAdvisor doesn't?
- [ ] Is it honest about downsides?
- [ ] Does it sound like a person, not a database?
- [ ] Are the images good, not just available?

**If unsure → don't publish, improve first**

## What Research Enables

The Jules database isn't content. It's ammunition for content.

### Example: Rhossili Bay Page

**What Jules provides:**
- Coordinates, parking location, facilities list
- 10 images with attribution
- Tide times source
- 3 nearby cafes with details
- Dog rules, lifeguard season
- 5 operators who run activities there
- Links to surf forecast
- Historical notes about shipwrecks
- Wildlife (seals, choughs)
- Transport links
- 15 data points from various sources

**What we write:**

> Rhossili regularly tops "best beach in Britain" lists, and for once the hype is justified. Three miles of sand backed by dunes, with the Worm's Head tidal island at the south end and Llangennith's surf break at the north.
>
> The catch? Everyone knows about it. The National Trust car park (£7/day, or free with membership) fills by 10am on summer weekends. Arrive early or park in Llangennith and walk south.
>
> **For families:** The main beach is vast but exposed. No rock pools here — for those, walk to the Worm (check tide times, you get 2.5 hours each side of low tide).
>
> **For surfers:** Keep walking north to Llangennith. The break at the Rhossili end is for experienced swimmers only — rips can be serious.
>
> **After:** The Worm's Head Hotel does decent pub food with the best view in Gower. Or drive 10 mins to Pitton Cross for better camping cafe vibes.

See the difference? Same facts, but shaped into something useful.

## Content Types & Effort

| Type | Research Needed | Writing Effort | Quality Bar |
|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Tier A spot profile | Deep | High | Would share with friend |
| "Best of" list | Broad | High | Defensible rankings |
| Region overview | Comprehensive | Medium | Useful orientation |
| Operator listing | Verified | Low | Accurate, fair |
| Activity hub | Strategic | Medium | Clear navigation |

---

## Red Flags

### This is spam:
- Template with just names swapped
- "X is a beautiful beach with golden sand"
- Same structure, same phrases, different place
- No opinion, no insight, no value-add
- Publishing everything in the database

### This is quality:
- Specific details that help planning
- Honest warnings and caveats
- Comparison to alternatives ("unlike X, this one...")
- Practical tips from experience
- Selective — not everything makes the cut

---

## Workflow by Page Type

### Spot Profile (Tier A)

1. **Research phase**
   - Pull all Jules data for this spot
   - Read reviews (TripAdvisor, Google)
   - Check competitor coverage
   - Find first-hand trip reports
   - Select best 3 images

2. **Writing phase**
   - Open with what makes it special (or not)
   - Cover practical info naturally (not as list dump)
   - Add genuine opinions
   - Include honest warnings
   - Write "after" recommendations

3. **Review phase**
   - Read aloud — does it sound human?
   - Check against quality gate 3
   - Verify facts against sources

### "Best Of" List

1. **Research phase**
   - Pull all spots in category
   - Apply Tier A/B filter
   - Rank by quality score + editorial judgment
   - Identify 10-15 for main list

2. **Writing phase**
   - Intro: What makes these "best" (our criteria)
   - Each item: Why it ranks here, not just what it is
   - Include "almost made it" section for depth
   - Add "best for X" alternatives

3. **Review phase**
   - Are rankings defensible?
   - Would locals agree (mostly)?
   - Is there genuine opinion?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **"Generate 50 beach pages from CSV"**
→ Creates spam, not content

❌ **"Every spot needs a page"**
→ Dilutes quality, wastes effort on Tier C

❌ **"Just fill in the template"**
→ Readers can smell templates

❌ **"Publish now, improve later"**
→ Later never comes, reputation damaged

❌ **"More pages = more SEO"**
→ Google penalizes thin content, rewards depth
