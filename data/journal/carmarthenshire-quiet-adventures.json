This is a guide to some easy hiking and kayaking spots where you can properly unwind.\n\n# Carmarthenshire: Quiet Rural Adventures\n\nCarmarthenshire often gets overlooked in favour of its more famous neighbours, but that's a damn shame. It's got a gentle beauty all its own, perfect for families or anyone wanting a bit of peace and quiet. Forget the queues and the Instagram hordes; here, you'll find space to breathe and enjoy the Welsh countryside at your own pace. It's a chance to reconnect with nature, and maybe even yourself, without feeling like you're stuck in a tourist trap.\n\n## Hiking Around Llansteffan\n\nLlansteffan is a proper charming village perched on the mouth of the River Towy. The big draw is Llansteffan Castle, a ruined Norman fortress. Don't expect a pristine castle experience; it's more of a grassy knoll with some impressive stonework still standing. But the views? Blimey, they're worth the short, sharp climb.\n\n**The Coastal Path:** From the castle, you can hop onto a section of the Wales Coast Path. Head east towards Scott's Bay. This is easy going, even for little legs. The path is well-maintained, mostly flat, and offers cracking views across the estuary. It's about 2 miles to Scott's Bay and back, making it a manageable hour or two. Pack a picnic; there are plenty of spots to stop and admire the scenery. Parking in Llansteffan can be tight, especially in summer. There's a car park near the beach (£3 for the day, card or cash), but it fills up quickly. Get there early or be prepared to walk a bit from the village.\n\n**Who's it for?:** This hike is ideal for families with young children or anyone wanting a relaxed stroll. It's dog-friendly too, just keep them on a lead, especially near the castle. Wheelchair access is limited due to the uneven terrain near the castle, but the coastal path itself is relatively accessible for the first mile or so.\n\n**Price:** Free, apart from the car park.\n\n**When to go:** Year-round, but best in spring and summer when the weather's milder. Autumn can be beautiful too, with the changing colours of the trees. Winter can be a bit bleak, but the views are still stunning.\n\n**Alternatives:** If you fancy something a bit more challenging, head further west along the Wales Coast Path towards Ferryside. This section is more rugged, with some steeper climbs and descents. It's still manageable, but requires a bit more effort. Or, consider a hike in the Brecon Beacons [brecon-beacons], about an hour and a half's drive away.\n\n## Kayaking on the River Towy\n\nThe River Towy (Afon Tywi in Welsh) is the longest river entirely within Wales, and it offers some superb kayaking opportunities, especially for beginners and families. The section between Llandeilo and Carmarthen is particularly good, with gentle currents and stunning scenery.\n\n**Paddling from Llandeilo:** You can hire kayaks from several places near Llandeilo, but I’d recommend calling ahead to check availability, especially during peak season. Expect to pay around £40-£60 for a half-day kayak rental, including paddles and buoyancy aids. Some operators will also offer guided tours for an extra fee.\n\n**The Experience:** The Towy is a relatively calm river, making it ideal for novice kayakers. The scenery is beautiful, with rolling hills, lush meadows, and ancient woodlands lining the riverbanks. Keep an eye out for wildlife; you might spot kingfishers, herons, and even otters. The journey from Llandeilo to Carmarthen is roughly 10 miles, which can be covered in about 3-4 hours at a leisurely pace. There are several places to stop for a picnic or a break along the way. Be sure to check the river conditions before you set off. While the Towy is generally calm, it can be affected by heavy rain, which can cause the water level to rise and the current to become stronger.\n\n**Parking:** There's free parking available in Llandeilo near the river. You can also park in Carmarthen and arrange for the kayak hire company to transport you to Llandeilo.\n\n**Who's it for?:** Kayaking on the Towy is perfect for families with older children (8+), couples, or anyone looking for a relaxing day on the water. It's beginner-friendly, but some basic paddling skills are required. If you're a complete novice, consider booking a guided tour.\n\n**When to go:** The best time for kayaking on the Towy is during the spring and summer months, when the weather is warm and the river is at its most inviting. Avoid kayaking during periods of heavy rain or high winds.\n\n**Alternatives:** For a different water-based adventure, consider paddleboarding on one of the many lakes in Mid Wales [mid-wales]. Llyn Brianne is a particularly scenic spot. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, try coasteering in Pembrokeshire [pembrokeshire].\n\n## Abergorlech Forest and Brechfa Forest\n\nIf you're looking for a taste of woodland wilderness, Abergorlech and Brechfa Forest are worth exploring. These forests offer a mix of walking and mountain biking trails, ranging from easy strolls to challenging climbs.\n\n**Walking Trails:** There are several well-marked walking trails in both forests, catering to different abilities. The \"Raven's Trail\" in Brechfa Forest is a good option for families, with a relatively flat and easy-to-follow path. It's about 3 miles long and takes around 1.5-2 hours to complete. For a more challenging hike, try the \"Gorlech Trail\" in Abergorlech Forest, which climbs to the top of a hill and offers panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.\n\n**Mountain Biking:** Brechfa Forest is particularly popular with mountain bikers, with a network of trails ranging from beginner-friendly routes to more technical singletrack. The \"Skills Area\" near Abergorlech is a great place for beginners to practice their skills.\n\n**Parking:** There are several car parks in both forests, but they can get busy during peak season. Parking is generally free.\n\n**Who's it for?:** These forests are ideal for families, couples, and anyone who enjoys walking or mountain biking in a natural setting. The walking trails are suitable for all abilities, while the mountain biking trails cater to different skill levels.\n\n**When to go:** The best time to visit these forests is during the spring, summer, and autumn months. Winter can be cold and wet, but the forests are still beautiful in their own way.\n\n**Alternatives:** For more mountain biking trails, head to Afan Forest Park in the South Wales Valleys [south-wales-valleys]. Or, for a more challenging hike, try climbing Fan Brycheiniog in the Brecon Beacons [brecon-beacons].\n\nCarmarthenshire might not be the most obvious choice for an adventure holiday, but it's a great option if you're looking for a slower pace and some genuinely lovely, less-crowded outdoor experiences. Give it a go; you might be surprised what you find.",
