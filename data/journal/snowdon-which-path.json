This guide breaks down the six main paths, from the gentle Llanberis Path to the knife-edge Crib Goch, helping you choose the perfect climb for your ability and experience.\n\n# Snowdon: Which Path Should You Take?\n\nSo, you’re thinking of tackling Snowdon, *Yr Wyddfa* in Welsh. Good on you. It's a cracking day out, but choosing the right path is crucial. It's not just about getting to the top; it's about enjoying the experience, staying safe, and knowing your limits. I've summited Snowdon more times than I care to count, in all sorts of weather, and I've seen far too many folk unprepared. This guide will give you the lowdown on the main routes, so you can make an informed choice.\n\n## The Six Main Routes Up Snowdon\n\nThere are six established paths to the summit, each with its own character, difficulty, and starting point. Let's break them down:\n\n*   **Llanberis Path:** The longest and arguably easiest.\n*   **Snowdon Ranger Path:** A historic route with stunning views.\n*   **Miners' Track:** A relatively easy start, but with a steeper finish.\n*   **Watkin Path:** The most challenging in terms of ascent and terrain.\n*   **Rhyd Ddu Path:** A quieter route with fantastic views.\n*   **Crib Goch:** A serious scramble, only for experienced mountaineers.\n\n### Llanberis Path: The Tourist Trail\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Llanberis (obvious, innit?)\n*   **Distance:** 9 miles (return)\n*   **Ascent:** 975m\n*   **Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate\n*   **Time:** 5-7 hours\n*   **Parking:** Loads of car parks in Llanberis, but they fill up fast, especially in summer. Expect to pay around £6-8 for the day.\n*   **Suitability:** Beginners, families, those looking for a gradual ascent.\n\nThe Llanberis Path is the classic tourist route for a reason. It’s long, but the gradient is generally gentle, making it a good option for those new to mountain walking. The path is well-maintained and easy to follow, and the views are decent, especially as you climb higher.\n\n**Downsides?** It's popular. In peak season, you'll be sharing the path with what feels like half of England. It can also be a bit monotonous in places. There's limited shelter. If the weather turns, you're exposed. If you want to avoid crowds, head up on a weekday or out of season. For a guided experience on the Llanberis Path, check out [MountainXperience](snowdonia). They offer guided walks for £45-65.\n\n### Snowdon Ranger Path: History and Views\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Near the Llyn Cwellyn car park, close to the Snowdon Ranger Hostel.\n*   **Distance:** 8 miles (return)\n*   **Ascent:** 935m\n*   **Difficulty:** Moderate\n*   **Time:** 5-6 hours\n*   **Parking:** Car park can get busy. Expect to pay around £5 for the day.\n*   **Suitability:** Those with some hiking experience, looking for a quieter route with good views.\n\nThis path follows a historic route used to guide Victorian tourists to the summit. It's a bit rougher underfoot than the Llanberis Path, with some rocky sections, but the views are arguably better. You get stunning vistas of Llyn Cwellyn and the surrounding valleys.\n\n**Things to consider:** The initial section can be boggy, especially after rain. There's a short scramble near the top, which might be tricky for some. It's generally less crowded than the Llanberis Path, but still popular, especially on weekends.\n\n### Miners' Track: A Tale of Two Halves\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Pen-y-Pass car park.\n*   **Distance:** 8 miles (return)\n*   **Ascent:** 720m\n*   **Difficulty:** Moderate\n*   **Time:** 5-6 hours\n*   **Parking:** Pen-y-Pass is notorious for its parking situation. It costs a bloody fortune (£20 in 2024, expect higher in 2025/2026) and fills up before dawn in peak season. Consider using the park-and-ride service from Llanberis or Nant Peris.\n*   **Suitability:** Those with moderate fitness, wanting a relatively quick ascent.\n\nThe Miners' Track starts off easy, following an old miners' road through a dramatic landscape. You'll pass the beautiful Llyn Llydaw and Llyn Glaslyn. However, the final ascent to the summit is steep and rocky, requiring some scrambling.\n\n**Be warned:** That final section is a killer if you're not prepared. The views from the top are fantastic, but you'll have earned them. The parking situation at Pen-y-Pass is a nightmare – plan ahead.\n\n### Watkin Path: The Toughest Grind\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Nant Gwynant, near Pont Bethania.\n*   **Distance:** 8 miles (return)\n*   **Ascent:** 1015m\n*   **Difficulty:** Challenging\n*   **Time:** 6-7 hours\n*   **Parking:** Limited parking in Nant Gwynant. Get there early. Free, but fills up rapidly.\n*   **Suitability:** Experienced hikers looking for a tough climb.\n\nThe Watkin Path is the most challenging of the six main routes. It starts near sea level, so you're climbing the entire height of the mountain. The terrain is varied, from woodland paths to rocky scree.\n\n**Honest assessment:** This is a tough one. The path is steep and unrelenting in places. The upper sections are rocky and exposed. Only attempt this if you're fit, experienced, and prepared for a long day. You will go past waterfalls, which is some compensation.\n\n### Rhyd Ddu Path: Peace and Quiet\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Rhyd Ddu village.\n*   **Distance:** 8.5 miles (return)\n*   **Ascent:** 895m\n*   **Difficulty:** Moderate\n*   **Time:** 5-6 hours\n*   **Parking:** Car park in Rhyd Ddu. £5 for the day.\n*   **Suitability:** Those seeking a quieter route with stunning views.\n\nThe Rhyd Ddu Path is a bit of a hidden gem. It's less popular than the other routes, so you're more likely to have some peace and quiet. The path is well-defined, but there are some rocky sections and a short, exposed ridge near the summit.\n\n**Good to know:** The views from the ridge are spectacular, but it can be unnerving if you're not comfortable with heights. This route offers some of the best panoramic views of Snowdonia. Rhyd Ddu is a charming little village, well worth exploring. It's also not far from the stunning Llyn Peninsula, should you want to make it part of a longer trip.\n\n### Crib Goch: For the Daredevils\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Pen-y-Pass car park.\n*   **Distance:** 7 miles (return – when combined with another path like the Pyg Track)\n*   **Ascent:** 950m\n*   **Difficulty:** Extreme\n*   **Time:** 5-7 hours\n*   **Parking:** See Miners' Track – Pen-y-Pass is a nightmare.\n*   **Suitability:** Experienced mountaineers only.\n\nCrib Goch is not a hiking path. It's a knife-edge arete. It's a scramble, and a very serious one at that. If you have a fear of heights, skip this one. Seriously. This is one for the adrenaline junkies.\n\n**What to expect:** Exposed ridges, sheer drops, and a high risk of injury. It requires a good head for heights, excellent scrambling skills, and appropriate footwear. Don't even think about attempting this in bad weather. It is often done as part of the Snowdon Horseshoe, but consider joining a guided walk with someone like [MountainXperience](snowdonia) if you aren't experienced. They offer guided walks of Crib Goch for around £55-75.\n\n## Essential Gear for Snowdon\n\nNo matter which path you choose, you'll need to be properly equipped. Here's a basic checklist:\n\n*   **Hiking boots:** Proper ankle support is essential.\n*   **Waterproof jacket and trousers:** The weather in Snowdonia can change in a heartbeat.\n*   **Warm layers:** Even in summer, it can get cold at the summit.\n*   **Plenty of water:** At least 2 litres.\n*   **Food:** High-energy snacks to keep you going.\n*   **Map and compass/GPS:** Know how to use them.\n*   **First-aid kit:** For minor injuries.\n*   **Headtorch:** In case you get caught out after dark.\n*   **Sunscreen and hat:** Protect yourself from the sun, even on cloudy days.\n\n## Weather in Snowdonia\n\nThe weather in Snowdonia is notoriously unpredictable. It can be sunny one minute and raining the next. Check the forecast before you go, but be prepared for all conditions. Mountain Forecast is your friend. Remember that the summit will almost always be colder and windier than the valley floor. And yes, it does snow on Snowdon, even in May and October.\n\n## Enjoy the Climb!\n\nClimbing Snowdon is a rewarding experience. Just remember to choose the right path for your ability, be properly prepared, and respect the mountain. And maybe, after your hike, treat yourself to a blast on the [Velocity 2 Zip Line](snowdonia) at Penrhyn Quarry – you'll have earned it.",
