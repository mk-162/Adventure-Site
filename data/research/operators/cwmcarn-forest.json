  "description": "Set in the heart of the South Wales valleys, Cwmcarn Forest is a haven where nature has reclaimed a previously mined landscape, transforming it into peaceful woodlands with spectacular views stretching to the Bristol Channel and Brecon Beacons. Just 10 minutes from Junction 28 of the M4, this accessible destination offers everything from a scenic 7-mile forest drive with eight stop-off points, adventure playgrounds, and sensory trails, to a modern visitor centre with café, gift shop, and camping facilities.\n\nCwmcarn is renowned as a mountain biking paradise, featuring five purpose-built trails catering to all skill levels. The blue-graded Pwca offers an accessible introduction, while the legendary red-graded Twrch and Cafall trails deliver 13km+ of hand-built singletrack through remote forest terrain. For adrenaline seekers, the black-graded Pedalhounds and the extreme-rated Y Mynydd downhill—designed by Phil Saxena and considered one of the UK's best DH venues—provide serious challenge. On-site uplift services, bike hire from PS Cycles, and a bike wash complete the package.\n\nBeyond biking, Cwmcarn offers diverse walking trails from gentle 1-mile strolls along the Nantcarn stream to the challenging 9-mile 1807 Walk and the rewarding climb to Twmbarlwm Iron Age hillfort. Families enjoy the Wildlife Explorer Challenge, adventure playgrounds, and the Visit Wales 4-star graded campsite with glamping pods and lodges. Ravens Café serves locally-sourced meals overlooking the river, making Cwmcarn a complete outdoor destination for day trips or extended stays.",
