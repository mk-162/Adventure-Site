# Do I Need a Rod Licence to Fish in Wales?

Yes. If you're fishing for salmon, trout, freshwater fish, or eels in Wales, you need a rod licence from Natural Resources Wales (NRW). No licence, no fishing — and the fines are up to £2,500.

## How Rod Licences Work in Wales

Wales has its own fisheries regulator — Natural Resources Wales — separate from the Environment Agency in England. However, an NRW rod licence covers you for fishing in both Wales and England, and vice versa, so if you already have an EA licence you're fine.

### Types and Costs (2024/25)

- **Full annual licence (salmon & sea trout):** £82
- **Full annual licence (trout & coarse):** £30
- **1-day licence (trout & coarse):** £6.60
- **8-day licence (trout & coarse):** £13.20
- **Junior (12–16):** Free, but you still need to register
- **Under 12:** No licence needed, but must be accompanied by a licensed adult
- **Senior (65+) / disabled concession:** Reduced rates available

Buy online at the [NRW website](https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences) — it takes about 5 minutes and your licence is valid immediately.

### What the Rod Licence Doesn't Cover

A rod licence gives you the legal right to use a rod and line. It does **not** give you permission to fish a specific water. For that, you'll also need:

- **Day tickets or permits** for specific rivers, lakes, and reservoirs
- **Club membership** for waters managed by angling clubs
- **Riparian owner permission** for private stretches

Most Welsh rivers are managed by angling associations who sell day tickets — expect to pay £5–£20 for a day on a decent stretch of river.

### Sea Fishing — No Licence Needed

Here's the good news: **sea fishing in Wales requires no rod licence**. Fish off the rocks at [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire), cast from the beaches of the [Gower](/gower), or head out on a charter boat from [Anglesey](/anglesey) — all licence-free. You just need to respect size limits and bag limits for species like bass.

### Best Fishing in Wales

Wales has world-class game fishing. The rivers Wye, Usk, Teifi, and Tywi are legendary for salmon and sea trout (sewin). The Llyn Peninsula and Snowdonia lakes offer brilliant wild brown trout fishing in stunning settings. For coarse fishing, the Shropshire Union Canal and Llangorse Lake in the Brecon Beacons are popular.
