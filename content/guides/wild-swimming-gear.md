# Wild Swimming Kit Guide

## The Essentials

*   **Swimsuit/Trunks:** Obvious, but worth mentioning. Wear something you're comfortable swimming in and that dries quickly.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Quick-drying is key. The Welsh weather can change rapidly, and you don't want to be shivering in wet swimwear all day.
*   **Towel:** Microfibre towels are lightweight and pack down small.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Space in your bag is at a premium when hiking to remote swimming spots, and drying quickly is a plus after a dip in potentially chilly water.
*   **Warm Layers:** A woolly hat, fleece/jumper, and warm socks are crucial, even in summer. A dry robe is an even better choice.
    *   **Why in Wales:** The temperature can drop significantly, especially after being in the water, and the wind chill factor can be high, even on sunny days. Beanie hats make a massive difference to perceived temperature.
*   **Waterproof Bag/Dry Bag:** Protect your valuables (phone, wallet, keys) from getting wet.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Rain is a distinct possibility, and even if it's dry, your bag might get splashed near the water's edge.
*   **Sturdy Footwear:** Walking boots or trail shoes are essential for accessing many wild swimming locations.
    *   **Why in Wales:** The terrain is often uneven, rocky, and potentially slippery. Flip-flops are a recipe for disaster.
*   **Floatation Device (Optional but Highly Recommended):** A tow float increases your visibility and provides something to hold onto if you get tired or cramp up.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Welsh waters can be deceptively strong, especially in rivers and near the coast. A tow float adds a significant safety margin.
*   **First Aid Kit:** A basic kit for minor cuts and grazes is essential.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Remote swimming spots mean help might be a long way off. Include blister plasters - you'll thank us.
*   **Mobile Phone (in waterproof case):** For emergencies and navigation.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Remote locations often have patchy signal, but it's worth having it in case you can get through to someone. Download offline maps beforehand.

## Nice to Have

*   **Wetsuit:** Extends your swimming season and allows you to stay in the water longer. Even a shorty wetsuit will help.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Welsh water temperatures can be cool, even in summer. A wetsuit provides crucial insulation.
*   **Swim Gloves & Socks:** For added warmth on very cold days.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Prolong your swim in the bracing Welsh waters.
*   **Water Shoes/Neoprene Socks:** Protect your feet from sharp rocks and cold water.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Many swimming spots have rocky entries and exits.
*   **Changing Robe/Dryrobe:** For easy and private changing outdoors.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Offers warmth and discretion in exposed locations.
*   **Hot Drink Flask:** A warm drink is incredibly welcome after a swim.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Helps you warm up quickly after a chilly dip.
*   **Goggles:** Improve visibility and protect your eyes.
*   **Snacks:** Energy bars or fruit for a post-swim energy boost.
*   **Headtorch/Flashlight:** If swimming at dusk or dawn or accessing locations in low light.

## Don't Bother With

*   **Expensive Waterproof Camera (unless you're a pro):** Your phone in a waterproof case is usually good enough for casual photos.
*   **Heavy Cotton Towels:** Bulky, slow-drying, and take up too much space.
*   **Fancy Swimming Gadgets:** Stick to the basics until you're a seasoned wild swimmer.
*   **Lilos/Inflatables (in most locations):** Unsuitable for rivers and open water due to currents and wind. Only consider for very calm, sheltered lakes.

## Hire vs Buy

*   **Wetsuit:** Worth hiring if you're only swimming occasionally or want to try different types. Local watersports centres and outdoor shops often offer wetsuit hire. If you plan on swimming regularly buy a wetsuit that fits well!
*   **Kayaks/SUPs:** Definitely hire these unless you're an experienced paddler. Many Welsh locations offer kayak and SUP hire, with safety briefings and guided tours.
*   **Tow Float:** Affordable to buy, but some locations may have them available for hire.
*   **Everything else:** Generally cheaper to buy your own essentials (towel, warm layers, etc.)

## Wales-Specific Tips

*   **Check Water Quality:** Before swimming, check for any pollution warnings or algae blooms from Natural Resources Wales.
*   **Be Aware of Tides:** Coastal swimming requires careful attention to tide times and currents. Consult tide tables and be cautious.
*   **Respect the Weather:** The weather in Wales can change rapidly. Check the forecast before you go and be prepared for all conditions.
*   **Tell Someone Your Plans:** Let someone know where you're going and when you expect to be back, especially if you're swimming alone.
*   **Watch Out for Livestock:** Be mindful of livestock grazing near swimming spots, especially sheep. Keep a safe distance and keep dogs under control.
*   **Leave No Trace:** Pack out everything you pack in, and leave the area as you found it.
*   **Rivers vs. Sea:** Rivers will be colder than the sea, and more subject to strong currents.
*   **Parking:** Many wild swimming locations are in remote areas with limited parking. Arrive early or be prepared to walk a bit.
*   **Welsh Water Temperature:** It's generally cooler than you might think! Be prepared, and don't underestimate how cold the water can be.
