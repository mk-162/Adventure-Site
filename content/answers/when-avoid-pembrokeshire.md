# When should I avoid visiting Pembrokeshire?

## Quick Answer

While Pembrokeshire's charm endures year-round, avoid the peak summer school holiday weeks (late July to late August) if you dislike crowds and inflated prices. Many accommodations get booked up a year in advance and coastal roads become congested. Also, be aware that some smaller attractions and boat trips reduce their schedules or close entirely from November to March.

## Dodging the Crowds and Cost

Pembrokeshire's popularity surges during the summer, particularly during the school holidays. Expect packed beaches like Barafundle Bay and Whitesands, long queues for attractions such as Pembroke Castle (£8-£10 entry), and limited parking at popular trailheads like the Pembrokeshire Coast Path near St Davids. Accommodation prices also skyrocket, with campsites charging double or triple their off-season rates and hotels often fully booked months in advance. For a quieter experience, consider visiting in the shoulder seasons (May-June or September-October), when the weather is often still pleasant, and the crowds have thinned out.

Another period to consider is the Tenby Ironman weekend (usually early September). While a fantastic event to watch, Tenby becomes extremely busy, and accommodation is at a premium. Roads in and out of the town will also be affected. For a more peaceful visit, plan your trip either before or after this event.

## Winter Considerations

While Pembrokeshire retains its rugged beauty in winter, some services are reduced or unavailable. Several campsites close for the season, and boat trips to Skomer Island (famous for its puffins) cease operating from October until April. The St Davids peninsula can feel particularly exposed during winter storms. However, if you're prepared for the weather, you can enjoy dramatic coastal walks without the crowds. Many pubs and restaurants remain open, offering cosy refuge after a bracing day outdoors.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Summer School Holidays (late July - late August) | Families seeking classic seaside fun | Moderate (crowd management) | All coastal areas |
| Tenby Ironman Weekend (early Sept) | Spectators of the event | High (crowds, traffic) | Tenby and surrounding areas |
| November - March | Solitude and dramatic coastal scenery | Moderate (weather dependent) | Pembrokeshire Coast Path |

## Practical Tips

- Book accommodations well in advance, especially if travelling during peak season. Check cancellation policies carefully.
- Consider using the Pembrokeshire Coast Bus (various routes) to avoid parking hassles at popular spots. A day ticket costs around £10.
- Check tide times before planning coastal walks, as some sections of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path are impassable at high tide.
- Pack for all types of weather, even in summer. Pembrokeshire weather can change quickly.
