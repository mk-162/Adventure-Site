# What should I expect on my first Coasteering experience?

## Quick Answer

Expect an exhilarating mix of cliff jumping, swimming, and rock scrambling along the stunning Welsh coastline. You'll be wearing a wetsuit, buoyancy aid, and helmet, and under the supervision of qualified instructors from companies like TYF Adventure in Pembrokeshire or Celtic Quest Coasteering in Anglesey. Be prepared for cold water, potential for scrapes and bruises, and a massive adrenaline rush!

## What a Typical Coasteering Session Looks Like

A typical coasteering session starts with a safety briefing and gear fitting at the operator's base, often near the coast. With TYF Adventure in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, you might start at their centre before heading to a nearby cove like Porthclais or Blue Lagoon (Abereiddi). Celtic Quest Coasteering operates around Holy Island, Anglesey, using the varied coastline near Trearddur Bay. Expect to spend around 3 hours in the water, starting with easier scrambles and swims to build confidence before progressing to bigger jumps (optional, of course!). Prices generally range from £45-£75 per person, depending on the location and operator. Bear in mind that coasteering is very tide-dependent, so session times will vary.

## Understanding the Challenges and Conditions

Coasteering isn't just about adrenaline; it requires a reasonable level of fitness and comfort in the water. The Welsh coast can be rugged, and even in summer, the water temperature can be chilly. Wetsuits help, but you'll still feel the cold after a while. Be prepared for slippery rocks, barnacles (which can scratch), and the occasional wave crashing over you. Some jumps can be intimidating, but good operators will never pressure you to do anything you're not comfortable with. They'll offer alternative routes and encouragement. The best time for coasteering is generally between May and September when the weather and water are milder, but sessions run year-round, weather permitting.

| Dragon Activity Guides | Small groups seeking a personal experience | Moderate | Gower Peninsula |

## Practical Tips

- Check the tide times before you go – coasteering is best around low tide.
- Wear old trainers or wetsuit boots for grip and protection on the rocks. Don't wear flip-flops!
- Bring a waterproof camera (like a GoPro) to capture the action, but make sure it's securely attached.
- Park at Whitesands Bay (near St Davids) early in peak season to avoid disappointment, then walk the coast path to find quieter coasteering spots (but only if you're experienced!).
- Let your instructor know immediately if you're feeling cold or uncomfortable.
