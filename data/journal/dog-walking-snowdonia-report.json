Here's what I learned taking my Border Collie up the Miners' Track.\n\n# Hiking Snowdonia With a Dog: Honest Report\n\nSo, you're thinking of tackling Snowdon with your four-legged pal? Fair play. It's a cracking mountain, and the views are worth the effort. But before you pack the kibble and head off, let's get real about hiking Snowdonia with a dog. This ain't a stroll in the park.\n\n## Choosing the Right Route\n\nForget Crib Goch unless your dog is part mountain goat (and you’re comfortable with exposed scrambling). Honestly, even experienced hikers should think twice about that one. For a dog-friendly option, you're mostly looking at the Llanberis Path, the Miners' Track, or the Watkin Path. We went with the Miners' Track.\n\nWhy the Miners' Track? Well, it's one of the easier routes, with a fairly gentle gradient most of the way. It's also relatively short, at about 8 miles round trip. And the scenery is pretty spectacular, passing by the old mine workings and the two lakes, Llyn Llydaw and Glaslyn.\n\nThe Llanberis Path is the longest and busiest, a well-made track that's relentlessly uphill but straightforward. The Watkin Path is tougher, with some steeper sections and a bit of scree to navigate. It's also arguably the most scenic.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't recommend the Pyg Track with a dog. There are some scrambly sections, and it can get dangerously crowded.\n\n### Assessing Your Dog's Fitness\n\nBe honest with yourself. Is your dog used to long walks and rough terrain? My Border Collie, Bryn, is a seasoned hiker, but even he was puffing a bit towards the top. If your dog is overweight, old, or has any health issues, maybe stick to lower-level walks in the Gower. There's no shame in choosing a walk that suits everyone.\n\n## On the Trail: Miners' Track Realities\n\nWe parked at the Pen y Pass car park (prepare to arrive early, especially in peak season. It's £10 for up to 4 hours and £20 for over 4 hours, and fills up fast. Alternatively, park in Llanberis and use the Sherpa bus service, which runs regularly and is dog-friendly).\n\nThe first section of the Miners' Track is easy going, a wide, well-maintained path. Bryn was in his element, sniffing every rock and chasing the odd sheep (bad dog!). The views across Llyn Llydaw are stunning, even on a cloudy day.\n\nThings got a bit trickier after the lakes. The path becomes steeper and rockier, and there are a couple of sections where you need to clamber over boulders. Bryn managed fine, but I had to give him a boost in a couple of places. Smaller dogs might struggle.\n\n### Weather or Not\n\nSnowdonia weather is notoriously unpredictable. We set off in sunshine, but by the time we reached the summit, we were in thick cloud with a biting wind. Always be prepared for all conditions, even in summer. Pack waterproofs, warm layers, and plenty of water for both you and your dog. I also carry a small first-aid kit for Bryn, including paw balm and a tick remover.\n\n### Summiting with a Dog\n\nThe summit of Snowdon can be a bit of a zoo, especially on a sunny weekend. It's crowded, noisy, and there's often a lot of litter. Keep your dog on a lead and be mindful of other people. Bryn wasn't too impressed with the crowds, so we didn't hang around for long.\n\nYou'll see the Snowdon Mountain Railway chugging up - maybe a tempting alternative on the way down, but dogs are only allowed at the discretion of the staff and only on certain services. Check in advance to avoid disappointment.\n\n## The Descent: More Challenging Than You Think\n\nGoing down can be harder than going up, especially on your knees. Watch your footing, and take it slow. Bryn was pulling a bit on the lead, eager to get back to the car, so I had to keep a close eye on him.\n\n### Unexpected Highlight\n\nOne of the best parts of the hike was actually a little stream we crossed on the way down. Bryn was overheating a bit, so he had a good splash around, cooling off and rehydrating. It was a welcome break for both of us.\n\n## Dog-Friendly Gear Essentials\n\n*   **Harness:** A good harness is essential for lifting your dog over obstacles.\n*   **Lead:** A short lead is best for keeping your dog under control on busy paths.\n*   **Water bottle and bowl:** Plenty of water is crucial, especially on a hot day.\n*   **Dog treats:** Motivation is key!\n*   **Poo bags:** Obviously. Leave no trace.\n*   **First-aid kit:** Paw balm, tick remover, and a bandage.\n\n## Alternative Snowdonia Adventures\n\nIf summiting Snowdon with your dog sounds a bit too ambitious, there are plenty of other great walks in Snowdonia. The Mawddach Trail near Barmouth is a flat, easy walk along a disused railway line, perfect for dogs of all abilities. Or you could explore the forests around Coed y Brenin, which offer a variety of trails for all levels, including the challenging mountain biking trails.\n\nFor something completely different, consider heading underground at Zip World Llechwedd and experience the Deep Mine Tour. While dogs aren't allowed on the tour itself, it's a fascinating glimpse into Snowdonia's industrial past.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nHiking Snowdonia with a dog is a rewarding experience, but it's not without its challenges. Choose your route carefully, be prepared for all weather conditions, and be honest about your dog's abilities. With a bit of planning and preparation, you and your furry friend can have a cracking day out in the mountains. Just remember to keep them on a lead and clean up after them - respect the mountain and other users. Now, fancy a pint?",
