# Fishing in Wales

Wales punches well above its weight for fishing. With over 1,000 fishing locations, legendary rivers like the Wye and Dee, and a dramatic coastline offering everything from shore casting to deep-sea charters, it's one of the best angling destinations in Britain.

The official Fishing in Wales website (fishingwales.net) maps the lot — but here's the practical guide to actually getting started.

## Types of Fishing

### Fly Fishing (Game)
The headline act. Welsh rivers are famous for:
- **Salmon** — River Wye (one of the UK's premier salmon rivers), River Dee, River Usk, River Teifi
- **Sea trout (sewin)** — Wales is the spiritual home of sewin fishing. The Teifi, Towy and Ogmore are legendary. Night fishing for sewin on a summer's evening is a uniquely Welsh experience.
- **Brown trout** — Wild brown trout in mountain streams across Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Mid Wales. The upper Severn near Caersws is excellent.
- **Grayling** — The Dee is nationally famous for grayling, with prolific numbers and fish regularly exceeding 2lb.

Season: March–October for most species. Grayling fishing runs into winter.

### Sea Angling
Wales has 870 miles of coastline, much of it excellent for fishing:
- **Shore fishing** — Bass, pollack, wrasse, flounder from rocks and beaches. Pembrokeshire and the Llŷn Peninsula are standout.
- **Charter boats** — Deep-sea trips for bass, pollack, tope, bream, bull huss. Boats run from Pembrokeshire, Anglesey and the Llŷn coast.
- **No licence needed** for sea fishing (unlike freshwater).

### Coarse Fishing
Less famous than the game fishing but still excellent:
- River Taff in Cardiff, River Dee, River Severn all hold quality coarse species.
- Pike, barbel, perch, carp available at various stillwaters and rivers.

## Where to Fish

### Wye Valley (Best for Salmon)
The River Wye is iconic. Day permits available through local angling associations. The stretches around Builth Wells and Hay-on-Wye are particularly good. Also excellent for grayling and brown trout.

### Mid Wales / Ceredigion (Best for Sea Trout)
The River Teifi is Wales's premier sea trout river. Notable catches include sewin to 17lb and salmon to 23lb. Llandysul Angling Association offers day, week and season permits on around 30 miles of the Teifi.

### Pembrokeshire (Best for Sea Angling)
Charter boats from Milford Haven and the south coast. Shore fishing from the rocks at St David's Head, Strumble Head, and around the Castlemartin coast.

### Snowdonia (Best for Wild Trout)
Mountain llyns (lakes) hold wild brown trout in stunning settings. Many are free to fish with the right rod licence. Rivers like the Glaslyn, Mawddach and Conwy offer variety.

## Practical Tips

- **Rod licence**: Required for all freshwater fishing in Wales. Buy online from the Environment Agency (yes, even in Wales). Around £30 for a year (trout/coarse), £82 for salmon/sea trout.
- **Permits**: Most rivers require a day permit from the local angling association. Typically £5–20 per day. Check fishingwales.net for details.
- **Guides**: If you're new to Welsh waters, a guided day is worth the investment. Local guides know which pools fish best in which conditions.
- **Season**: Salmon/trout March–October. Coarse fishing mostly year-round. Sea fishing year-round but species vary by season.
- **Equipment**: Most guides provide tackle for beginners. For DIY, check what's available locally — many small towns in fishing country have tackle shops.

## Best Time to Visit

- **Spring (March–May)**: Rivers coming into form, brown trout active. Early salmon runs on the Wye.
- **Summer (June–August)**: Prime sewin time on the Teifi and Towy. Night fishing at its best. Sea angling in full swing.
- **Autumn (September–October)**: Salmon running hard. Arguably the most exciting time for game fishing. Autumn colours on the riverbanks.
- **Winter (November–February)**: Grayling season on the Dee. Shore fishing for cod, whiting and dogfish. Many rivers closed for game fishing.

## Who It's For

Fishing in Wales spans the spectrum. Families can try a stocked trout lake for a guaranteed catch. Serious anglers travel from across Europe for the Wye salmon or Teifi sewin. Sea fishing off Pembrokeshire needs no prior experience — the charter skippers do the hard work. And there's something genuinely meditative about fly fishing a quiet mountain stream in Snowdonia with nobody else around.
