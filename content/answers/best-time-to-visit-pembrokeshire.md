# What is the Best Time to Visit Pembrokeshire?

## Quick Answer

The best time to visit Pembrokeshire depends on your priorities. For the warmest weather and peak season buzz, July and August are ideal, but expect larger crowds and higher prices. For outdoor activities like coasteering, sea kayaking, and surfing, June and September offer a sweet spot with milder weather, fewer crowds, and still-warm sea temperatures.

## The Detail

*   **June & September: Shoulder Season Sweet Spot:** These months offer a great balance. The weather is generally pleasant for outdoor activities (average highs in the high teens Celsius), and the sea is still relatively warm from the summer heat. You'll also encounter fewer crowds at popular spots like beaches and coastal paths, and accommodation prices tend to be lower. Sea conditions are often calmer, making it ideal for Sea Kayaking Safaris. Critically, this period allows for all Coasteering activities to go ahead safely.

*   **July & August: Peak Season:** The warmest months, with average highs in the low 20s Celsius. This is when Pembrokeshire is at its liveliest, with all attractions and activities in full swing. The sea is at its warmest, making it perfect for swimming and surfing. Boat Trips to Ramsey Island are very popular during this period. However, expect crowded beaches, booked-up accommodation, and higher prices.

*   **Spring (April & May):** Wildflowers bloom, and the countryside comes alive. The weather can be unpredictable, but you'll find quieter trails and potentially good deals on accommodation. Sea temperatures are still cool, so wetsuits are essential for watersports. This is a great time for Rock Climbing, when the cliff faces dry out.

*   **Autumn (October):** The crowds have thinned, and the landscape takes on beautiful autumnal colors. The weather can be changeable, but you might still get some sunny days. Sea temperatures are dropping, so fewer opportunities for some watersports without proper gear.

*   **Winter (November - March):** Pembrokeshire is at its quietest during winter. Many attractions and some accommodations close. The weather can be harsh, with strong winds and rain. However, you'll find solitude and dramatic coastal scenery, ideal for bracing walks. Certain types of Surfing are still possible with the right wetsuit.

**Activity Considerations:**

*   **Coasteering & Sea Kayaking:** June and September offer the best balance of good weather, fewer crowds, and safe sea conditions. July and August are also good, but be prepared for busier conditions.
*   **Surfing:** Consistent swells arrive throughout the year, but conditions are generally best in the autumn and winter months. Summer offers mellower waves suitable for beginners.
*   **Wildlife Boat Tours:** These operate mainly from April to October, with the peak season coinciding with puffin breeding season (May-July).
*   **Rock Climbing:** Drier conditions are ideal. Spring and summer are often best.

## The Smart Choice

For me, **September is the sweet spot**. The sea is still warm enough for coasteering and sea kayaking, the crowds have gone home, and the prices are lower. Plus, the light in September is often beautiful, perfect for photography. If warm weather is your absolute priority and you don't mind the crowds, then July or August might be better, but be sure to book well in advance.
