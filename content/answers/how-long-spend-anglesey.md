# How many days should I spend in Anglesey?

## Quick Answer

To truly experience Anglesey (Ynys Môn), plan for at least three full days. This allows time to explore the stunning coastal path, delve into the island's rich history at Beaumaris Castle, and enjoy some watersports around Trearddur Bay. Five days would be ideal for a more relaxed pace, incorporating activities like coasteering with providers such as Anglesey Adventures (£60-£80 per person) and exploring hidden coves.

## Coastal Exploration & Historical Sites

Anglesey boasts a spectacular coastline, much of which is accessible via the Anglesey Coastal Path. Allocate at least one full day to hike a section of this path. A popular choice is the stretch from Moelfre to Bull Bay, offering dramatic cliff views and the chance to spot seals. Allow 4-5 hours for this moderate 8-mile hike. History buffs should dedicate a morning to Beaumaris Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Entrance fees are around £7-£9. In the afternoon, consider visiting Plas Newydd House and Gardens (National Trust), offering stunning views of Snowdonia across the Menai Strait.

## Watersports and Adventure Activities

Anglesey is a haven for watersports enthusiasts. Trearddur Bay is renowned for its sandy beach and clear waters, perfect for kayaking, paddleboarding, and windsurfing. Several local operators offer rentals and lessons, with prices ranging from £20-£40 per hour. For a more adrenaline-fueled experience, try coasteering with Anglesey Adventures in Holyhead. This involves traversing the coastline by swimming, climbing, and jumping – a thrilling way to explore the island's rugged shores. Consider a boat trip to Puffin Island from Beaumaris to see the puffins between April and July.

## Practical Tips

- Book accommodation and activities in advance, especially during peak season (June-August). Campsites like Penrhos Caravan Park get booked up quickly.
- Check the tide times before planning coastal walks or watersports activities. Some areas become inaccessible at high tide.
- Pack for all types of weather. Anglesey can experience sunshine, rain, and wind all in the same day!
- Consider purchasing an Anglesey Explorer Pass for discounts on entry to attractions and activities.
