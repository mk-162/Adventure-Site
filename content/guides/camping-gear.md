# Camping in Wales - What to Pack

Wales offers some of the most stunning camping locations in the UK, from rugged coastlines to the serene Brecon Beacons. However, the Welsh weather is notoriously unpredictable, so packing the right gear is crucial for a safe, comfortable, and enjoyable experience. This guide will walk you through the essential equipment, offer advice on what to leave behind, and provide practical tips to ensure your camping trip is a success, whatever the weather throws at you.

## Essential Kit

### Shelter: Tent
Your tent is your home away from home. Choose a tent appropriate for the season and number of occupants. Look for a tent with a good waterproof rating (at least 3000mm hydrostatic head) and sturdy poles to withstand potential wind and rain. Consider a tent with a porch area for storing muddy boots and gear. For backpacking, prioritize lightweight models; for car camping, comfort and space may be more important.

### Sleeping: Sleeping Bag & Mat
A good night's sleep is essential for enjoying your days exploring Wales. Select a sleeping bag rated for the expected temperatures, erring on the warmer side – Welsh nights can get surprisingly cold, even in summer. A sleeping mat provides insulation from the ground and adds comfort. Inflatable mats are lightweight and pack small, while foam mats are more durable and offer better insulation in colder conditions. Consider a pillow for extra comfort.

### Cooking: Stove & Utensils
If you plan on cooking your own meals, a portable stove is a must. Gas stoves are easy to use and provide good heat control. Multi-fuel stoves are more versatile and can run on different types of fuel, which can be useful in remote areas. Don't forget fuel! Pack essential cooking utensils, plates, bowls, cups, and cutlery. A washing-up kit with biodegradable soap is also essential for keeping your campsite clean.

### Clothing: Layers are Key
The key to staying comfortable in Wales is layering. Start with a moisture-wicking base layer to keep sweat away from your skin. Add an insulating mid-layer, such as a fleece or down jacket, for warmth. A waterproof and windproof outer layer is essential for protection from the elements. Pack waterproof trousers as well as a jacket. Don't forget warm socks, a hat, and gloves, even in summer.

### Footwear: Hiking Boots
Sturdy, waterproof hiking boots are essential for exploring the Welsh countryside. Choose boots that provide good ankle support and traction, especially if you plan on tackling any challenging hikes. Break in your boots before your trip to avoid blisters. Pack a pair of comfortable camp shoes or sandals for relaxing around the campsite.

### Navigation: Map & Compass (and GPS)
While technology is useful, a map and compass are crucial for navigating in areas with limited phone signal. Learn how to use them! A GPS device can be a helpful addition, but always carry backup navigation tools. Familiarize yourself with your planned route before you set off.

### Lighting: Headtorch
A headtorch is essential for navigating around the campsite at night and for any late-evening hikes. Choose a headtorch with a good battery life and adjustable brightness settings. Pack spare batteries.

## Nice to Have

-   **Camp Chair:** For relaxing in comfort around the campfire.
-   **Binoculars:** For wildlife spotting and enjoying the views.
-   **Camera:** To capture the stunning Welsh scenery.
-   **First-aid Kit:** Comprehensive kit with blister treatment, pain relief, antiseptic wipes, and any personal medication.

## What to Leave at Home

-   **Glass Bottles:** Heavy and easily broken; opt for plastic or metal alternatives.
-   **Excessive Toiletries:** Stick to essentials and travel-sized bottles to save weight and space.

## Hire vs Buy

Consider hiring larger or more expensive items, such as tents or sleeping bags, especially if you are new to camping or only planning a short trip. Local outdoor gear shops often offer rental services. It is often better to invest in your own hiking boots, as fit is paramount.

## Budget Options

Prioritize buying quality used gear from reputable outdoor stores or online marketplaces. Shop sales and clearance events for discounted items. Focus on investing in essential items like a waterproof jacket and comfortable footwear. Save money by cooking your own meals rather than eating out.

## Top Camping Spots in Wales

*   **Hillfort campsite, Llanmadoc (Gower):** Small, simple site on the edge of the Gower AONB. Walk to Whiteford Sands and Rhossili from your tent. Book early — it fills up fast.
*   **Shell Island, Llanbedr (Snowdonia):** Massive, wild-feeling site with direct beach access. Slightly chaotic but kids love it. The causeway floods at high tide — check times.
*   **Cwmcarn Forest, near Newport:** Woodland camping with mountain biking trails on your doorstep. [Find mountain biking in South Wales](/south-wales/things-to-do/mountain-biking).
*   **Trefalen Farm, St Davids (Pembrokeshire):** Small campsite minutes from the coast path. Perfect base for [coasteering](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/coasteering) and coastal walking.
*   **Llyn Gwynant, Snowdonia:** Lakeside camping with Snowdon views. Swim in the lake, hike from the tent, watch the sun set behind the mountains. One of the best locations in Wales.
*   **Priory Mill Farm, Brecon Beacons:** Quiet site near the Usk Valley. Great for [gorge walking](/brecon-beacons/things-to-do/gorge-walking) and caving, with stargazing from the Dark Sky Reserve on clear nights.

## Pro Tips

-   **Waterproof everything:** Use dry bags or plastic bags to protect gear from rain. In Wales, it *will* rain at some point.
-   **Test your gear at home:** Set up your tent and test your stove before you arrive. Discovering a broken pole in a Welsh field at dusk is miserable.
-   **Respect the pitch:** Leave no trace. Pack out all rubbish, use designated fire pits only, and respect wildlife.
-   **Wild camping etiquette:** Wild camping is technically tolerated (not legal) in some upland areas of Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons. Pitch late, leave early, and leave zero trace. Stay above the enclosed farmland line and away from roads.
