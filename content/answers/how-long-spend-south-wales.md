# How many days should I spend in South Wales?

## Quick Answer

To truly experience South Wales' diverse adventure offerings, aim for at least 3-5 days. This allows you to explore the Brecon Beacons National Park, surf the Gower Peninsula, and delve into the region's industrial heritage. For a more in-depth exploration, including activities like canyoning or mountain biking, a week is ideal.

## Crafting Your South Wales Adventure Itinerary

South Wales packs a punch when it comes to outdoor activities. A 3-day itinerary might focus on the Brecon Beacons, hiking to Pen y Fan (allow 3-4 hours, free, but parking at Storey Arms can be busy) and perhaps a guided caving experience with companies like Adventure Britain (£45-£75 per person).  You could then spend a day exploring the Gower Peninsula, surfing at Llangennith (lessons from £35 with Gower Surf Academy) and enjoying the coastal path walks around Three Cliffs Bay.

Extending your stay to 5 days or a week allows for deeper exploration. Consider a day trip to the Afan Forest Park, renowned for its mountain biking trails (bike hire from £30 per day).  Alternatively, explore the industrial heritage with a visit to Big Pit National Coal Museum (free entry, pre-booking essential) or try your hand at gorge walking with TYF Adventure in the Brecon Beacons (£60-£80 per person). Remember that weather in South Wales can be unpredictable, so pack accordingly and have backup plans.

- Book adventure activities in advance, particularly during peak season (summer and school holidays), to avoid disappointment.
