Here's what we got up to, from underground bouncing to hurtling through the air.\n\n# Rainy Week in Snowdonia — What We Actually Did\n\nLet's be honest, booking a week in Snowdonia in October is always a gamble. We knew the odds of sunshine were slim, but we went anyway, figuring we'd embrace whatever the Welsh weather threw at us. And boy, did it throw. Rain, sideways rain, drizzle, and the occasional biblical downpour were the order of the day. But we still managed to have a cracking time. Here’s how we salvaged a soggy week:\n\n## Ditching the Mountain (for now)\n\nThe original plan involved some serious mountain walking. I had my eye on finally tackling Crib Goch, maybe even with a guided walk from [MountainXperience](https://example.com/mountainxperience), whose prices are around £55-75. My mate fancied the [Snowdon Summit Hike](https://example.com/snowdon-summit-hike) with [Snowdonia Mountain Guides](https://example.com/snowdonia-mountain-guides) for £60-80.\n\nYeah, that didn't happen.\n\nThe cloud base was so low you could barely see past the nearest sheep, and the wind was howling. Common sense prevailed. Instead, we decided to embrace the underground.\n\n## Bounce Below: Underground Trampolines\n\nFirst up: [Bounce Below](https://example.com/bounce-below) at [Zip World](https://example.com/zip-world). Now, I'll admit, I was skeptical. Underground trampolines? Sounded a bit… touristy. But I was wrong. It's brilliant fun. You’re kitted out with a helmet and given a safety briefing (essential, trust me), then you descend into the old slate mine. The nets are strung across huge caverns, and bouncing around in the dark with colored lights is surprisingly exhilarating.\n\nCost us £30 each (price range is £25-35 depending on the time of year). Parking was easy, right outside the entrance. This is a great option for families and folks who want a unique experience, but maybe skip it if you suffer from claustrophobia.\n\n### The Slate Mine Itself\n\nWhile at the Llechwedd site, and given the weather, we also decided to give the [Underground Adventure](https://example.com/underground-adventure) a go. The Zip World Llechwedd site isn’t just about the trampolines and zip lines. They also run guided tours of the Victorian slate mines. For around £25 each, it's a fascinating glimpse into the area’s industrial past, and frankly, a welcome break from the rain. The guide was excellent, full of knowledge and dry humour (Welsh humour, obviously). Suitable for all ages and fitness levels.\n\n## Zip Lining: Conquering the Fear (and the Rain)\n\nThe next day, the rain was showing no signs of letting up, so we decided to go all-in on the adrenaline activities. We booked ourselves onto the [Velocity 2 Zip Line](https://example.com/velocity-2-zip-line) again with [Zip World](https://example.com/zip-world). I'd done it before, but my mate was a zip-lining virgin. He was terrified.\n\nVelocity 2 is essentially a massive zip line across a disused quarry. You reach speeds of over 100mph. It's exhilarating, terrifying, and utterly brilliant. At £99 each (prices vary from £89-109), it's not cheap, but it's an experience you won't forget.\n\nThe views, even in the rain, were stunning. It wasn't ideal weather – the wind was whipping, and the rain stung your face – but it added to the sense of adventure. My mate was white as a sheet before we set off, but afterwards, he was buzzing. Conquered his fear and all that.\n\n### Zip World Fforest Coaster - A Damp Thrill\n\nLater that afternoon, still buzzing from the heights of Velocity 2, we headed to Zip World Fforest, near Betws-y-Coed. We hopped on the [Fforest Coaster](https://example.com/zip-world-fforest-coaster) (£30 each). It’s a gravity-driven toboggan run through the woods. Despite the rain, it was a blast! The trees offered some shelter, but we still got pretty soaked. It’s family-friendly, but still provides a decent adrenaline rush. The drive between the two Zip World locations (Llechwedd and Fforest) is about 45 minutes, and parking at Fforest is clearly signposted but can get busy.\n\n## Mountain Biking: Embracing the Mud at Coed y Brenin\n\nOkay, so we'd had our fill of underground and aerial adventures. But we still wanted to get out into the (sort of) great outdoors. We decided to head to [Coed y Brenin](https://example.com/coed-y-brenin), the renowned mountain biking center.\n\nI'm no expert mountain biker, so we stuck to the [MinorTaur](https://example.com/minortaur) trail (easy/moderate). My mate, however, fancied himself as the next Danny MacAskill and decided to tackle the [Temtiwr](https://example.com/temtiwr) trail (difficult). I watched him disappear into the distance, shaking my head.\n\nTwo hours later, he reappeared, covered head-to-toe in mud, with a sheepish grin on his face. \"That was...challenging,\" he admitted. Turns out the Temtiwr trail is not for the faint of heart, especially in the wet.\n\nCoed y Brenin is fantastic, though. Even in the rain, the trails are well-maintained, and the forest is beautiful. Parking costs between £2 and £7 depending on how long you stay. There's a decent cafe and bike shop on site, which is handy if you need to clean up or repair any damage (which my mate definitely did).\n\nIf mountain biking isn't your thing, there are plenty of walking trails too. It's a good option for a day out, rain or shine.\n\n## Lessons Learned: Embrace the Wet\n\nSo, what did we learn from our rainy week in Snowdonia?\n\n*   **Don't be afraid to change your plans.** The mountains will still be there next time.\n*   **Embrace the weather.** Waterproofs are essential, but so is a sense of humor.\n*   **There's more to Snowdonia than just mountains.** The underground adventures are brilliant, and there are plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.\n\nWe could easily have driven over to Anglesey for some coastal walks (even in the rain, the views can be stunning), or headed south to the Brecon Beacons for some caving.\n\nOverall, it wasn't the trip we planned, but it was still a fantastic adventure. And who knows, maybe next time we'll actually see the sun. But I wouldn't bet on it.",
