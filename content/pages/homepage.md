# Introduction

We're not a travel brochure. We tell you which Snowdon route fits your fitness, which coastline stays calm when the wind picks up, and which operators actually know what they're doing. Real local knowledge for people who want to get outdoors, not read about it.

Every activity on here includes who it's for, who should skip it, and what the locals know that tourists don't. Because picking the right adventure beats picking a pretty one.

# Featured Regions

## Snowdonia
Mountains, quarries, and some of Europe's best adventure infrastructure. Six Snowdon routes for six different fitness levels. World-class zip lines in repurposed slate mines. Gets busy on weekends - we'll tell you when to go.

## Pembrokeshire
The coasteering capital of the UK. South-facing cliffs that stay warmer when everywhere else is getting battered. Less rain than Snowdonia, better beaches than Devon. Best from May to September.

## Brecon Beacons
Quieter than Snowdonia, wilder than the Gower. Waterfalls you can actually swim in, mountain biking that won't kill you, and dark skies worth staying up for. Underrated by everyone except the people who keep coming back.

# Popular Activities

## Coasteering
Jump off cliffs, swim through caves, scramble along rocks you'd never find from a path. Pembrokeshire invented it. Suitable from age 8 up - no experience needed, just willingness to get properly cold and properly thrilled.

## Mountain Biking
Coed y Brenin has purpose-built trails from family-gentle to leg-destroying. Antur Stiniog does downhill that rivals the Alps. BikePark Wales near Merthyr is the biggest in the UK. Hire bikes everywhere.

## Hiking
Six routes up Snowdon alone - from the tourist path to the scramble where people die every year. We'll help you pick the right one. Plus hundreds of quieter walks the guidebooks skip.

## Zip Lining
Velocity 2 in Penrhyn Quarry - the fastest zip line in Europe. Book months ahead or don't bother turning up. Minimum age 10, maximum fear level: high.
