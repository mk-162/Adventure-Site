    "full": "Skyline Skydiving operates from Withybush Airfield near Haverfordwest, offering the only skydiving experience in West Wales and Pembrokeshire. Located in the heart of the stunning Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, this dropzone provides some of the most spectacular coastal scenery for skydivers in the UK.\n\nOperating as Air Adventures Wales (part of The Skydive Centre network), this fully licensed skydive centre offers tandem skydiving experiences at extremely competitive rates. The location gives you breathtaking views over the rugged Pembrokeshire coastline, St Brides Bay, and on clear days you can see across to Ireland and the islands of Skomer, Skokholm, and Grassholm.\n\nThe centre specializes in making skydiving accessible and affordable, with tandem jumps from 7,000ft (upgradeable to 10,000ft subject to conditions). Every jump is conducted by experienced, BPA-qualified instructors who prioritize your safety while ensuring you have an unforgettable experience. The airfield operates every weekend (Saturday and Sunday) and Bank Holiday Mondays from March through October.\n\nWhat makes Haverfordwest unique is its coastal location - you're jumping over one of Britain's most beautiful stretches of coastline.

On-site facilities include a café serving hot and cold food and drinks, making it comfortable for jumpers and spectators alike."
