## Research Process

### Phase 1: Mass Discovery (Days 1-2)
1. Go through EVERY source listed above
2. Extract ALL Welsh events for 2026
3. Create initial list with basic data (name, date, location, source)
4. Don't worry about completeness yet — volume first

### Phase 2: Deduplication (Day 3)
1. Sort by event name
2. Identify duplicates (same event on multiple platforms)
3. Merge data from multiple sources
4. Mark primary source for each event

### Phase 3: Enrichment (Days 4-5)
1. For each event, visit official website
2. Fill in missing fields
3. Get accurate pricing, distances, descriptions
4. Capture lat/lng coordinates

### Phase 4: Verification (Day 6)
1. Verify dates are 2026 (not historical)
2. Confirm events are still running
3. Flag uncertain data
4. Quality check descriptions
