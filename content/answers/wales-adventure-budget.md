# How Much Does an Adventure Holiday in Wales Cost?

## Quick Answer

A long weekend of proper adventure in Wales runs **£150–£400 per person** depending on how you sleep and what you do. Budget camping and free hikes at one end, guided multi-activity packages with a nice Airbnb at the other. Wales offers exceptional value compared to Scottish Highlands or Lake District — and you're never far from a proper café.

## Accommodation Costs (2024/2025)

### Camping
**£10–£25 per night** at proper campsites.

Top value picks:
- **Llyn Gwynant Campsite** (Snowdonia lakeside) — £12-18/night
- **Cae Du Campsite** (Llŷn Peninsula) — £10-14/night
- **Trefalen Farm** (Pembrokeshire) — £12-16/night
- **Priory Mill Farm** (Brecon Beacons) — £10-15/night

Wild camping is technically not legal in Wales (unlike Scotland), but informal bivvying on open land away from habitation is widely tolerated if you're sensible — free, obviously. [Read the wild camping rules →](/answers/wild-camping-wales)
