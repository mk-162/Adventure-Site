# How many days should I spend in Carmarthenshire?

## Quick Answer

To truly experience Carmarthenshire's diverse landscapes, from the Brecon Beacons National Park in the east to the stunning coastline, aim for a minimum of three days. A week allows you to delve deeper, exploring hidden gems like the National Botanic Garden of Wales, indulging in local produce, and tackling more challenging hikes. For a comprehensive adventure including both coast and countryside, five days is ideal.

## Coastal Adventures and Seaside Towns

Carmarthenshire's coastline offers a mix of sandy beaches, dramatic cliffs, and charming seaside towns. Spend a day exploring Llansteffan, with its iconic castle overlooking the Tâf Estuary; entry to the castle is free, allowing you to soak in the history and views without spending a penny. For a more active day, head to Pendine Sands, famous for land speed records. You can walk the entire 7-mile stretch at low tide, or even try your hand at blokarting with a local operator like Pendine Outdoors (prices from £35 per person). Consider visiting during the spring or summer months for the best weather, but be aware that parking in popular areas like Pendine can be limited during peak season.

Another option is to explore the Gower Peninsula, which is a short drive from Carmarthenshire. Here you can experience world-class surfing at Rhossili Bay, or hike along the coastal path.

## Inland Exploration and Brecon Beacons

Venture inland to discover Carmarthenshire's rolling hills and the western reaches of the Brecon Beacons National Park. Allocate at least two days to explore this area. Hike to the summit of Fan Brycheiniog for panoramic views (allow 4-5 hours for a round trip), or explore the network of trails around Llyn y Fan Fach, a glacial lake steeped in Welsh folklore. For a unique experience, consider a guided foraging walk with Wild Food UK (courses from £65 per person), learning about the edible plants and fungi of the region. Be prepared for changeable weather, even in summer, and always check the forecast before heading out onto the hills.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Coastal Hike (Pendine to Laugharne) | Families, history buffs | Easy | Pendine Sands |
| Brecon Beacons Hike (Fan Brycheiniog) | Experienced hikers | Strenuous | Brecon Beacons National Park |
| National Botanic Garden of Wales | Garden lovers, families | Easy | Llanarthne |

## Practical Tips

- Check tide times before visiting coastal areas like Pendine Sands and Llansteffan. Some beaches disappear completely at high tide.
- Book accommodations and activities in advance, especially during the summer months and school holidays, as Carmarthenshire is a popular destination.
- Visit local markets in towns like Carmarthen and Llandeilo for fresh produce and artisan crafts. The Carmarthen market is held every Wednesday and Saturday.
- Be aware that mobile phone signal can be patchy in some rural areas of Carmarthenshire, especially in the Brecon Beacons. Download offline maps before you go.
