# What to Pack for Hiking in Wales

Forget the endless gear lists. This is about what you *actually* need to enjoy hiking in Wales, based on years of experience. We're talking practical, not aspirational.

## The Essentials

*   **Waterproof Jacket (and Trousers):** This is non-negotiable. Welsh weather is notoriously unpredictable. Expect rain, wind, and sudden changes. A good quality, breathable waterproof jacket is your best friend. Waterproof trousers are almost as essential; think boggy ground and persistent drizzle.
*   **Hiking Boots (broken in!):** Wales offers a diverse terrain, from rocky mountains to muddy valleys. Ankle support and good grip are crucial. Blisters will ruin your trip, so ensure your boots are well broken in *before* you arrive.
*   **Navigation (Map & Compass/GPS):** Relying solely on phone signal in the Welsh mountains is a recipe for disaster. Download offline maps (e.g., OS Maps app) and/or bring a physical Ordnance Survey map and compass. Know how to use them.
*   **Headtorch (with spare batteries):** Even if you plan a short hike, daylight hours can be shorter than expected, especially in winter. Also useful in an emergency.
*   **First Aid Kit (basic):** Blister plasters, antiseptic wipes, pain killers, and a bandage are essential. Customize it to any personal medical needs.
*   **Emergency Whistle:** A simple, lightweight way to signal for help if you get into trouble. Six short blasts repeated is the international distress signal.
*   **Food & Water (more than you think):** Weather can slow you down. Pack high-energy snacks (nuts, energy bars) and more water than you think you'll need. Hypothermia can strike even in relatively mild temperatures if you're wet and undernourished. A flask of something warm is a great morale booster.
*   **Warm Layers (fleece/insulated jacket):** Even in summer, the temperature can drop significantly at higher altitudes. A fleece or lightweight insulated jacket is vital. Wool or synthetic layers are preferable to cotton as they retain warmth when wet.
*   **Hat and Gloves:** Protect your extremities, even in summer. Wind chill can be significant.

## Nice to Have

*   **Hiking Poles:** Helpful for steep ascents and descents, especially if you have knee problems. They provide extra stability on uneven terrain.
*   **Gaiters:** Prevent mud and water from getting into your boots, particularly useful on boggy trails.
*   **Sunscreen and Sunglasses:** Yes, even in Wales! When the sun *does* shine, it can be surprisingly strong, especially at altitude.
*   **Small Backpack (20-30 Litres):** To carry all your essentials comfortably. Look for one with a rain cover.
*   **Portable Power Bank:** If you're using your phone for navigation or photography, a power bank can be a lifesaver.
*   **Binoculars:** For spotting wildlife or enjoying the views.
*   **Camera:** Capture the stunning Welsh scenery.
*   **Sit Mat:** A lightweight mat to sit on during breaks, keeps you dry and comfortable.

## Don't Bother With

*   **Heavy Hiking Stove & Cooking Gear (for day hikes):** Unless you're planning a proper cook-up, a thermos and some snacks are usually sufficient for a day hike. Saves weight and hassle.
*   **Excessive Clothing:** Overpacking is a common mistake. Stick to the essentials and focus on layering.
*   **Cotton Clothing:** Avoid cotton as a base layer, as it absorbs moisture and takes a long time to dry, making you cold.
*   **Expensive, Non-Waterproof Electronics:** Unless you're a professional photographer, leave the expensive camera equipment at home. Stick to your phone (in a waterproof case) or a small, rugged digital camera.
*   **Unnecessary Gadgets:** Leave the fancy multi-tools and survival gear at home unless you have specific wilderness survival training.

## Hire vs Buy

*   **Hiking Boots:** If you only plan to hike occasionally, hiring good quality boots from a local outdoor gear shop is a cost-effective option. Ensure they fit properly.
*   **Specialized Gear (e.g., Crampons, Ice Axe):** Only needed for winter mountaineering. Hire these locally from a reputable provider who can also offer instruction on their use.
*   **Waterproofs:** If you're unsure about sizing or quality, hiring before committing to a purchase can be wise.

Generally, items like waterproof jackets, navigation tools, and essential safety equipment are worth investing in if you plan to hike regularly.

## Where to Go Hiking in Wales

*   **Snowdonia National Park:** Home to Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) and the dramatic Glyderau and Carneddau ranges. Everything from gentle lakeside walks to serious scrambles like Crib Goch. [Find hiking in Snowdonia](/snowdonia/things-to-do/hiking).
*   **Brecon Beacons:** Pen y Fan is the popular choice, but the waterfall walks around Ystradfellte and the Black Mountains ridge are arguably better. [Find hiking in the Brecon Beacons](/brecon-beacons/things-to-do/hiking).
*   **Pembrokeshire Coast Path:** 186 miles of stunning coastal walking. Pick a section — St Davids to Solva or Tenby to Manorbier are both excellent. [Find hiking in Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/hiking).
*   **Llŷn Peninsula:** Quiet coastal paths with views to Bardsey Island. Empty even in summer. [Find hiking on the Llŷn Peninsula](/llyn-peninsula/things-to-do/hiking).
*   **Wye Valley:** Lower-level walking through ancient woodland. The stretch from Tintern to Monmouth is gorgeous in autumn.

## Wales-Specific Tips

*   **Weather:** Be prepared for *anything*. Check the mountain weather forecast (Met Office Mountain Forecast or MWIS) before you go. Conditions on Snowdon's summit can be 15°C colder than the car park.
*   **Terrain:** Expect everything from rocky scree to knee-deep bog. The Carneddau and Rhinogydd ranges are particularly rough underfoot. Good boots earn their keep in Wales.
*   **Remoteness:** Parts of Snowdonia, the Rhinogydd, and Mid Wales are genuinely remote. Tell someone your route and expected return time. Carry a whistle and emergency shelter.
*   **Livestock:** Sheep are everywhere on open hillsides. Keep dogs on leads near livestock — Welsh farmers take this seriously, and they're right to.
*   **Right to Roam:** Wales has extensive open access land, but respect the Countryside Code. Close gates, stick to paths through farmland, and take your litter home.
*   **Language:** Trail names and place names are Welsh. "Cwm" means valley, "llyn" means lake, "afon" means river. Learning a few words helps with navigation and locals appreciate the effort.
