# Is Coasteering Safe?

## Quick Answer

Coasteering has inherent risks — you're scrambling on rocks, swimming in the sea, and potentially jumping off cliffs. But with a qualified, experienced guide and proper equipment, it has an excellent safety record. The biggest risk factor isn't the activity itself; it's people doing it without professional guidance or in unsuitable conditions.

## The Detail

Coasteering involves navigating rocky coastlines, swimming in open water, and (optionally) jumping from varying heights. The potential risks include:

*   **Slips and falls on rocks** — barnacle-covered, seaweed-slick rocks are the main culprit for minor injuries (scrapes, bruises)
*   **Cold water shock** — Welsh sea temperatures range from 8-16°C. Even with a wetsuit, entering the water is a shock to the system
*   **Strong currents and swells** — tidal currents around headlands and in channels can be powerful, especially in Pembrokeshire
*   **Impact injuries from jumps** — misjudging depth, angle, or landing position
*   **Exhaustion** — swimming in a wetsuit against currents is more tiring than you'd expect

### How Professional Operators Manage These Risks

Reputable Welsh coasteering operators take safety extremely seriously:

*   **Thorough risk assessment:** Guides check weather, tides, swell, wind, and sea state before every session. If conditions aren't right, they reroute or cancel. A good operator cancels more sessions than a bad one.
*   **Detailed safety briefings:** Before you get near the water, you'll be taught how to enter and exit safely, how to position your body for jumps, and what to do if you get separated.
*   **Proper equipment:** 5mm wetsuits provide buoyancy as well as warmth. Buoyancy aids keep you floating even if you're tired. Helmets protect against rock impacts.
*   **Experienced guides:** Welsh coasteering guides typically hold qualifications from bodies like the Institute for Outdoor Learning (IOL) or National Governing Body awards. They know their stretch of coastline intimately — every current, every submerged rock, every safe jump spot.
*   **Group management:** Guides maintain close supervision. Group sizes are kept manageable (typically 6-12 per guide). They watch for signs of cold, fatigue, or anxiety.
*   **Jump assessment:** Before anyone jumps, the guide enters the water, checks depth, checks for submerged hazards, and demonstrates the correct technique. Every jump is assessed fresh — conditions change with the tide.

### Putting It in Perspective

Under professional guidance, coasteering is safer than many activities people do without thinking twice. Statistically, you're more likely to injure yourself on a casual hike or a day at the beach than on a guided coasteering session. The combination of professional assessment, proper equipment, and expert guidance significantly reduces the inherent risks.

The danger comes from doing it unsupervised. People who see coasteering videos and try to replicate them without understanding tides, currents, or jump safety are at genuine risk. Don't be that person.

## Choosing a Safe Operator

When booking, look for:
*   **AALA licensing** (Adventure Activities Licensing Authority) — legally required for operators working with under-18s, but a good sign for all operators
*   **Qualified, experienced guides** — ask about their qualifications and how long they've been operating on that stretch of coast
*   **Good recent reviews** — particularly comments about safety briefings and guide attentiveness
*   **Willingness to cancel** — an operator who runs in marginal conditions is a red flag. A good operator prioritises your safety over your booking
*   **Proper kit provision** — good-quality wetsuits that fit properly, not worn-out hand-me-downs

## The Smart Choice

Coasteering is one of the most exhilarating things you can do in Wales, and it's genuinely safe with the right operator. Book with a reputable Pembrokeshire or Anglesey provider, be honest about your swimming ability and fitness level, and listen to your guide. If you're nervous, say so — good guides adapt the route. Start with a standard session rather than an "extreme" or "advanced" option. And remember: the jumps are always optional.
