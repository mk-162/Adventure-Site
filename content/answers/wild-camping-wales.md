# Can You Wild Camp in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Wild camping is technically illegal in Wales, as it is in the rest of the UK, without the landowner's permission. However, a "leave no trace" approach is generally tolerated in some of the more remote upland areas, particularly within Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons National Parks. Always prioritize responsible practices and respect the environment.

## The Detail

While there isn't a formal right to wild camp, responsible wild camping is often practiced, especially in the more remote areas of Wales. Here's what you need to consider:

*   **Land Ownership:** Most land in Wales is privately owned. Technically, you need the landowner's permission to camp. Getting explicit permission is always the best approach, but not always practical.
*   **National Park Authority Guidelines:** Snowdonia and Brecon Beacons National Park Authorities don't explicitly permit wild camping but acknowledge its presence. Their focus is on minimizing impact.
*   **"Leave No Trace" is Key:** This is absolutely crucial.
    *   **Pitch Late, Leave Early:** Arrive late in the evening, set up discreetly, and leave at first light.
    *   **Small Tent, Small Group:** Use a small, dark-colored tent and keep your group size to a minimum (1-2 people).
    *   **Pack Out EVERYTHING:** Carry out all your rubbish, including food scraps. Do not bury anything.
    *   **No Fires:** Use a camping stove for cooking. Fires are a significant fire risk and cause lasting damage.
    *   **Toilet Responsibly:** If no toilet facilities are available, bury human waste at least 6 inches deep and 200 feet away from water sources. Pack out toilet paper.
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Areas:** Stay away from cultivated land, livestock, and archaeological sites.

*   **Alternatives:** If you're not comfortable with the legal ambiguity, consider these options:
    *   **Campsites:** Wales has numerous campsites, from basic to fully equipped.
    *   **Bothies:** These simple shelters are free to use and offer basic accommodation (check for availability beforehand).
    *   **Consider locations near activities:** If you are planning on doing a Snowdon Summit Hike, consider a campsite near Llanberis for example.

## The Smart Choice

Personally, if I'm planning a multi-day hike like tackling Crib Goch or the Llanberis Path, I'd research remote, less-traveled areas within Snowdonia and practice ultra-responsible wild camping, prioritizing "leave no trace" above all else. However, for a less stressful experience, especially with a family, established campsites are the better choice. Consider booking in advance, particularly during peak season. Be aware of potential parking restrictions and charges when considering wild camping near trailheads.
