I just got back from five days hoofing it around Snowdonia solo, and I\u2019m here to tell you the truth \u2013 the whole, soggy, sheep-dodging truth. It wasn\u2019t all Instagram-perfect peaks and breathtaking vistas (though there *were* some of those). This is a trip report for the realistic traveller.\n\n## Why Snowdonia?\n\nWhy *not* Snowdonia? I needed a break from the grind, a proper lungful of fresh air, and a chance to remind myself that I can still navigate a map and compass. I'd been fancying a good hike, and while the Brecon Beacons are lovely, Snowdonia just felt a bit\u2026wilder. Plus, I'd heard good things about the trails around Beddgelert. I wasn\u2019t wrong.\n\n## Planning & Prep: Don't Skimp\n\nFirst things first: get yourself a decent map. An Ordnance Survey map is essential; don\u2019t rely solely on your phone. Seriously. I picked up the OS Explorer OL17 \"Snowdon & Conwy Valley\" at Cotswold Outdoor for \u00a39.99. Worth every penny, especially when the phone signal vanished near Nant Gwynant.\n\nAccommodation-wise, I opted for a mix of hostels and B&Bs to keep costs down. The Bryn Dinas Camping Pods near Nant Gwynant were a great find - \u00a360 a night for a small but cozy space. Booking ahead is crucial, especially if you're going during peak season (summer or school holidays). And check reviews! I nearly booked a place with a \"charming\" damp problem...dodged that bullet.\n\nI also checked the weather forecast religiously in the days leading up to the trip. Snowdonia in October? Expect rain. And wind. And possibly a rogue sheep trying to steal your sandwich. I packed accordingly: waterproof everything (jacket, trousers, backpack cover), layers, sturdy hiking boots, and a flask of something strong.\n\n## Day 1: Arrival and a Gentle Warm-Up\n\nI drove from Cardiff (about 4 hours, allow extra time for the inevitable traffic jams around Abergavenny) and arrived in Beddgelert mid-afternoon. Beddgelert itself is a pretty village, but parking can be a nightmare. The main car park charges around \u00a36 for the day.\n\nAfter checking into my B&B (Gwesty Bach, perfectly adequate for \u00a375 a night), I decided to stretch my legs with a short walk along the Gelert's Grave path. It's an easy, mostly flat trail that follows the river, perfect for a gentle warm-up. Took about an hour, and I even saw a dipper bobbing around in the water.\n\n## Day 2: The Watkin Path to Snowdon\n\nRight, Snowdon. Everyone wants to bag that peak, don't they? I chose the Watkin Path, supposedly the most scenic route. It\u2019s also the longest, and arguably one of the tougher ones. I set off early (around 8 am) to avoid the crowds. Parking at the Watkin Path car park (Pont Bethania, \u00a36 for the day) fills up quickly.\n\nThe Watkin Path starts off easy enough, following a stream through woodland. But then it gets steep. Very steep. And rocky. My calves were screaming by the time I reached the old slate quarry. The views, though, were stunning. Even with the clouds swirling around the summit, I could see all the way down to the coast.\n\nThe final ascent to the summit is a bit of a scramble, but nothing too technical. The summit itself was\u2026packed. Loads of people, all jostling for photos. I grabbed a quick snap, scoffed a pasty (obligatory, isn't it?), and started the descent. The way down was brutal on the knees, but manageable. Took about 6 hours in total.\n\nIf you're not a seasoned hiker, consider a guided walk. Snowdonia Mountain Guides offer a Llanberis Path Guided Walk for around \u00a345-65. It\u2019s less strenuous, and you'll learn a thing or two about the area.\n\n## Day 3: Coed y Brenin and a Mountain Bike Mishap\n\nI fancied a change of pace, so I headed to Coed y Brenin Forest Park for some mountain biking. Coed y Brenin is a proper mountain biking mecca, with trails to suit all abilities. Parking is \u00a32-7 depending on how long you stay.\n\nI decided to tackle the MinorTaur trail, a blue-graded route that\u2019s supposed to be family-friendly. It *is* mostly easy, with some fun swooping sections through the forest. However, I came a cropper on one of the berms, ended up in a hedge, and slightly twisted my ankle. Bugger.\n\nLuckily, I wasn\u2019t too badly hurt, and I managed to limp back to the visitor centre. The bike shop there was helpful, and they patched me up with a bandage. Lesson learned: even on \"easy\" trails, wear proper protective gear (helmet, gloves, knee pads).\n\nMy biking plans scuppered, I spent the rest of the day hobbling around Beddgelert, drinking tea and feeling sorry for myself.\n\n## Day 4: Exploring the Llyn Peninsula\n\nWith my ankle still a bit sore, I decided to take it easy and explore the Llyn Peninsula. It\u2019s about an hour\u2019s drive from Beddgelert, and well worth the trip. The coastline is stunning, with dramatic cliffs, sandy beaches, and charming little villages.\n\nI drove to Aberdaron (parking \u00a34 for the day), a small village at the very tip of the peninsula. From there, I walked a section of the Wales Coast Path, enjoying the views out to Bardsey Island. The path is mostly flat and easy to follow.\n\nThe Llyn Peninsula is a great alternative if the weather's bad in Snowdonia, or if you just fancy a change of scenery. Plenty of options for walking, watersports, and generally soaking up the coastal atmosphere. Consider taking a boat trip to Bardsey Island for a bit of history and wildlife spotting.\n\n## Day 5: Zip World and Homeward Bound\n\nFor my last day, I decided to inject a bit of adrenaline into the trip. I booked a slot at Zip World Velocity 2 in Bethesda. This is the fastest zip line in the world, apparently. Pricey at \u00a389-109, but worth it for the experience.\n\nStrapped into a harness and hurtling down a mountain at over 100mph? Absolutely bonkers. But also incredibly exhilarating. The views from the top are amazing, and the feeling of flying is\u2026well, unforgettable.\n\nZip World also offers Bounce Below (underground trampolines) and the Fforest Coaster (a toboggan run). Something for everyone, really.\n\nAfter Zip World, it was time to head home. The drive back to Cardiff felt long, but I was buzzing from the zip line experience.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nSnowdonia is a fantastic destination for solo female travelers. It\u2019s challenging, beautiful, and full of opportunities for adventure. Just be prepared for the weather, pack accordingly, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n\nWould I go back? Absolutely. Next time, I might try some white water rafting at the National White Water Centre or perhaps a scrambling course with MountainXperience. There\u2019s always something new to discover in this corner of Wales.",
