# What are the hidden gems and secret spots in Snowdonia?

## Quick Answer

Snowdonia (Eryri) is packed with well-known attractions, but the real magic lies in its lesser-known spots. Discover secluded waterfalls like Rhaeadr Ewynnol, challenge yourself with the Crib Goch scrambling route (for experienced hikers only!), or explore the quiet beauty of the Nant Gwynant valley. For a unique experience, try canyoning with a local operator like Gaia Adventures in Betws-y-Coed.

## Secluded Waterfalls and Wild Swimming

Beyond the popular Fairy Pools, Snowdonia hides some truly stunning waterfalls perfect for a refreshing dip. Rhaeadr Ewynnol, near Llanberis, offers a series of cascading falls and plunge pools. Be aware that the rocks can be slippery, and the water is cold, even in summer. For a longer hike, try searching out the waterfalls in the Ogwen Valley, but stick to marked paths and check weather conditions before you set off. Wild swimming in Llyn Ogwen is also popular, but again, be mindful of the cold water and only swim if you are an experienced open-water swimmer. Always check water quality warnings before entering any water source.

For a guided experience, consider booking a canyoning adventure with Gaia Adventures. They offer trips suitable for different ability levels, typically ranging from £60-£100 per person, including equipment and instruction.

## Remote Hiking and Scrambling

While Snowdon's summit path can be crowded, many quieter trails offer stunning views. The Nant Gwynant valley provides gentler walking routes with beautiful scenery, ideal for families and less experienced hikers. For seasoned adventurers, the Crib Goch arete offers a thrilling scramble, but it's extremely dangerous and should only be attempted by experienced mountaineers in perfect weather conditions. Always check mountain weather forecasts and be prepared for sudden changes.

Another option is the Moel Siabod ascent, offering panoramic views without the Snowdon crowds. The route involves some scrambling but is generally less exposed than Crib Goch. Local mountain guides, such as those affiliated with Plas y Brenin, the National Mountain Sports Centre, offer guided ascents of Moel Siabod for around £75 per person.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Rhaeadr Ewynnol Waterfall | Short walk, wild swimming | Easy | Near Llanberis |
| Nant Gwynant Valley | Gentle hikes, family walks | Easy to Moderate | Nant Gwynant |
| Crib Goch | Experienced mountaineers, scrambling | Extremely Difficult | Snowdon Range |
| Moel Siabod | Challenging hike, panoramic views | Moderate to Difficult | Near Capel Curig |

## Practical Tips

- Park responsibly in designated areas. Snowdonia's narrow lanes are easily blocked by inconsiderate parking, especially during peak season.
- Check the Snowdonia National Park Authority website for up-to-date information on trail closures, parking restrictions, and safety advice.
- Book activities in advance, particularly during school holidays. Popular operators like Zip World and Go Below often sell out weeks in advance.
- Pack for all weather conditions, even in summer. Snowdonia's mountains can experience sudden and dramatic weather changes. Layers are key, along with waterproofs and sturdy hiking boots.
