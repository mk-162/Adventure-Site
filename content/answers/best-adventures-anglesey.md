# What are the best adventure activities in Anglesey?

## Quick Answer

Anglesey (Ynys Môn) is an adventure playground! Try coasteering with Coastal Adventures from Porth Dafarch (£50-£60), or tackle the adrenaline-pumping RibRide Velocity trip from Menai Bridge for a high-speed blast under the iconic bridges (£35-£45). For something different, explore the island's stunning coastline by kayak, launching from Trearddur Bay.

## Coastal Adventures and Sea Kayaking

Anglesey's coastline is perfect for exploring, and coasteering is a fantastic way to get up close and personal with the cliffs and coves. Coastal Adventures, based near Holyhead, offers excellent guided coasteering experiences from Porth Dafarch, known for its clear waters and dramatic rock formations. Expect to pay around £50-£60 for a half-day session. They provide all the gear, but bring sturdy footwear! Alternatively, rent a kayak from Anglesey Adventures in Trearddur Bay (approx. £30-£40 per day) and explore the coastline at your own pace. Be mindful of the tides and weather conditions, as they can change rapidly. For experienced kayakers, circumnavigating Holy Island offers a challenging but rewarding day trip.

For a unique perspective, consider a guided sea kayaking tour to explore hidden caves and secluded beaches. Several operators offer tours suitable for all skill levels, starting from various locations around the island, including Beaumaris and Moelfre. Prices typically range from £40 to £70 per person, depending on the duration and location. Always check the weather forecast and sea conditions before heading out.

## Thrill-Seeking and High-Speed Adventures

If you're after an adrenaline rush, RibRide offers exhilarating high-speed boat trips along the Menai Strait. Their Velocity trip, departing from Menai Bridge, takes you on a thrilling ride under the Menai Suspension Bridge and the Britannia Bridge, reaching speeds of up to 50 mph. Prices range from £35-£45. Be prepared to get wet! For a bird's-eye view of the island, consider a scenic flight from Mona Flying Club near Bodorgan. Prices vary depending on the length of the flight and the route, but expect to pay around £100-£200 for a 30-minute flight.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Coasteering with Coastal Adventures | Exploring the coastline up close | Moderate | Porth Dafarch |
| RibRide Velocity | Adrenaline junkies | Easy | Menai Bridge |
| Sea Kayaking from Trearddur Bay | Independent exploration | Moderate to Advanced | Trearddur Bay |

## Practical Tips

- Check tide times before planning any coastal activities. Anglesey has a significant tidal range, and some areas become inaccessible at high tide.
- Book RibRide in advance, especially during peak season. They often sell out weeks in advance.
- Pack waterproofs, even on sunny days. The weather can change quickly, especially near the coast.
- Park at the main Trearddur Bay car park and walk down to the beach to avoid parking congestion during summer.
