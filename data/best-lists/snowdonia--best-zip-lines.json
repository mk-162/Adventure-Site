  "introduction": "Wales has more world-class zip lines per capita than any country on earth. That's not a joke — Zip World alone operates the fastest zip line in the world and the longest in Europe, both in North Wales.\n\nBut it's not just about Zip World. From family-friendly forest runs to genuine 100mph+ experiences over flooded quarries, Wales has zip line experiences for every age and adrenaline threshold. Most are concentrated in and around Snowdonia, taking advantage of the dramatic quarry landscapes and mountain terrain.\n\nThis list covers dedicated zip line experiences, not zip wires that are part of adventure parks. Prices range from £20 to £75 per person. Book in advance for summer weekends — the popular ones sell out weeks ahead.",
  "rankingCriteria": "We've ridden all of these zip lines. Rankings factor in speed/thrill factor, scenery, the overall experience (from booking to landing), and value for money. We also consider whether the experience lives up to the marketing.",
