# Wild Swimming Kit Guide

## The Essentials

*   **Swimsuit/Trunks:** Obvious, but worth mentioning. Wear something you're comfortable swimming in and that dries quickly.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Quick-drying is key. The Welsh weather can change rapidly, and you don't want to be shivering in wet swimwear all day.
*   **Towel:** Microfibre towels are lightweight and pack down small.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Space in your bag is at a premium when hiking to remote swimming spots, and drying quickly is a plus after a dip in potentially chilly water.
*   **Warm Layers:** A woolly hat, fleece/jumper, and warm socks are crucial, even in summer. A dry robe is an even better choice.
    *   **Why in Wales:** The temperature can drop significantly, especially after being in the water, and the wind chill factor can be high, even on sunny days. Beanie hats make a massive difference to perceived temperature.
*   **Waterproof Bag/Dry Bag:** Protect your valuables (phone, wallet, keys) from getting wet.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Rain is a distinct possibility, and even if it's dry, your bag might get splashed near the water's edge.
*   **Sturdy Footwear:** Walking boots or trail shoes are essential for accessing many wild swimming locations.
    *   **Why in Wales:** The terrain is often uneven, rocky, and potentially slippery. Flip-flops are a recipe for disaster.
*   **Floatation Device (Optional but Highly Recommended):** A tow float increases your visibility and provides something to hold onto if you get tired or cramp up.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Welsh waters can be deceptively strong, especially in rivers and near the coast. A tow float adds a significant safety margin.
*   **First Aid Kit:** A basic kit for minor cuts and grazes is essential.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Remote swimming spots mean help might be a long way off. Include blister plasters - you'll thank us.
*   **Mobile Phone (in waterproof case):** For emergencies and navigation.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Remote locations often have patchy signal, but it's worth having it in case you can get through to someone. Download offline maps beforehand.

## Nice to Have

*   **Wetsuit:** Extends your swimming season and allows you to stay in the water longer. Even a shorty wetsuit will help.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Welsh water temperatures can be cool, even in summer. A wetsuit provides crucial insulation.
*   **Swim Gloves & Socks:** For added warmth on very cold days.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Prolong your swim in the bracing Welsh waters.
*   **Water Shoes/Neoprene Socks:** Protect your feet from sharp rocks and cold water.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Many swimming spots have rocky entries and exits.
*   **Changing Robe/Dryrobe:** For easy and private changing outdoors.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Offers warmth and discretion in exposed locations.
*   **Hot Drink Flask:** A warm drink is incredibly welcome after a swim.
    *   **Why in Wales:** Helps you warm up quickly after a chilly dip.
*   **Goggles:** Improve visibility and protect your eyes.
*   **Snacks:** Energy bars or fruit for a post-swim energy boost.
*   **Headtorch/Flashlight:** If swimming at dusk or dawn or accessing locations in low light.

## Don't Bother With

*   **Expensive Waterproof Camera (unless you're a pro):** Your phone in a waterproof case is usually good enough for casual photos.
*   **Heavy Cotton Towels:** Bulky, slow-drying, and take up too much space.
*   **Fancy Swimming Gadgets:** Stick to the basics until you're a seasoned wild swimmer.
*   **Lilos/Inflatables (in most locations):** Unsuitable for rivers and open water due to currents and wind. Only consider for very calm, sheltered lakes.

## Hire vs Buy

*   **Wetsuit:** Worth hiring if you're only swimming occasionally or want to try different types. Local watersports centres and outdoor shops often offer wetsuit hire. If you plan on swimming regularly buy a wetsuit that fits well!
*   **Kayaks/SUPs:** Definitely hire these unless you're an experienced paddler. Many Welsh locations offer kayak and SUP hire, with safety briefings and guided tours.
*   **Tow Float:** Affordable to buy, but some locations may have them available for hire.
*   **Everything else:** Generally cheaper to buy your own essentials (towel, warm layers, etc.)

## Top Wild Swimming Spots in Wales

*   **Blue Lagoon, Abereiddy (Pembrokeshire):** A flooded slate quarry with deep, cold, incredibly clear water. Dramatic but the entry/exit is rocky — water shoes essential. Genuinely freezing even in August.
*   **Llyn Padarn (Snowdonia):** A large lake near Llanberis with easy access and mountain views. Popular with open water swimmers. Water quality is good but temperatures rarely top 16°C.
*   **Fairy Glen, Betws-y-Coed (Snowdonia):** A magical river pool surrounded by rock walls and trees. Access involves a short walk. Currents can be strong after rain — check conditions.
*   **Barafundle Bay (Pembrokeshire):** Sheltered sea swimming in crystal-clear water. The walk down keeps crowds manageable. One of the best beach swims in Wales. [Find wild swimming in Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/wild-swimming).
*   **River Usk near Crickhowell (Brecon Beacons):** Gentle river swimming with gravel beaches. Warmer than mountain lakes but still fresh. [Find wild swimming in the Brecon Beacons](/brecon-beacons/things-to-do/wild-swimming).
*   **Llyn Idwal (Snowdonia):** Dramatic glacial lake below the Devil's Kitchen. Very cold, very atmospheric, and a short walk from the road.

## Wales-Specific Tips

*   **Check water quality:** Natural Resources Wales publishes bathing water quality reports. After heavy rain, river and sea water quality can drop — give it 48 hours.
*   **Tides are critical for sea swimming:** Pembrokeshire's tidal range is massive. Beaches that look perfect at low tide become impassable at high tide. Check tide tables.
*   **Respect the weather:** If it's been raining hard, rivers rise fast. The Fairy Glen can go from a gentle pool to a raging torrent overnight. Don't swim in flooded rivers.
*   **Tell someone your plans:** Especially for remote spots. Many wild swimming locations have zero phone signal.
*   **Rivers vs. sea:** Welsh rivers are generally colder than the sea (mountain-fed) and can have surprisingly strong currents. The sea is warmer but has tides and swell to consider.
*   **Parking is limited:** Popular spots like the Blue Lagoon and Fairy Glen have tiny car parks that fill by 10am in summer. Arrive early or be prepared to walk.
*   **Temperature reality:** Llyn Idwal is around 8-10°C even in July. The Blue Lagoon is similar. River Usk might hit 16°C in a warm August. Acclimatise gradually — don't jump straight in.
