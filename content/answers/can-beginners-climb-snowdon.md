# Can Beginners Climb Snowdon?

## Quick Answer

Yes, absolutely — but you need to choose the right route, pick a decent weather day, and come properly prepared. The Llanberis Path is the most straightforward route with a gradual incline and well-maintained surface. It's around 9 miles round trip and takes 5-7 hours. It's demanding but doable for anyone with reasonable fitness who can walk uphill for extended periods.

## The Detail

Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) is the highest peak in Wales at 1,085m. It's not a technical climb — you don't need ropes or specialist climbing equipment on the main paths. But it's still a proper mountain, and every year Mountain Rescue are called out to help people who've underestimated it.

### Route Comparison for Beginners

| Route | Distance | Difficulty | Best For |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Llanberis Path** | 9 miles / 14.5km | Easiest | First-timers, families with older children |
| **Miners' Track** | 8 miles / 12.8km | Moderate | Beginners who want more interesting scenery |
| **Pyg Track** | 7 miles / 11.2km | Moderate | Shorter but steeper, some scrambling near the top |
| **Snowdon Ranger** | 8 miles / 13km | Moderate | Quieter alternative with great views |
| **Watkin Path** | 8 miles / 12.8km | Hard | Steep and exposed — not for beginners |
| **Crib Goch** | Via Horseshoe | Expert only | Knife-edge scramble — genuinely dangerous in bad conditions |

**The Llanberis Path** follows the railway line for much of its length. It's the longest route but the most gradual. The surface is good for most of the way, though it gets rockier near the summit. It can feel like a conveyor belt on busy summer days, but there's comfort in having other people around if you're nervous.

**The Miners' Track** is more scenic, passing stunning mountain lakes (Llyn Llydaw and Glaslyn). It's relatively flat until you reach the zig-zags below the summit, where it gets steep and rocky. Slightly more interesting than Llanberis for the same fitness level.

### Fitness Requirements

Be honest with yourself:
*   Can you walk briskly uphill for 2-3 hours without stopping? You'll be fine on Llanberis.
*   Do you get out of breath on a flight of stairs? Build up your fitness first. Start with shorter, lower hills and work up.
*   The total ascent is around 950m — that's a lot of uphill. Your legs will know about it.

### What You'll Need

*   **Proper hiking boots** — broken in, waterproof, with ankle support. Trainers aren't suitable.
*   **Waterproof jacket and trousers** — non-negotiable. The summit can be 15°C colder than the car park, with driving rain and wind.
*   **Warm layers** — fleece, hat, gloves. Even in summer. The summit is exposed.
*   **Food and water** — at least 2 litres of water and high-energy snacks. There's a café at the summit (Hafod Eryri) but it's not always open.
*   **Navigation** — the paths are well-marked in clear weather, but cloud descends quickly. Download offline OS Maps or carry a physical map.
*   **Headtorch** — in case you're slower than expected and daylight runs out.

### Weather Is Everything

This cannot be overstated. Snowdon creates its own weather. It can be sunny in Llanberis and blizzarding on the summit simultaneously. Check the **Met Office Mountain Forecast** or **MWIS** (Mountain Weather Information Service) on the morning of your walk. If cloud base is below 800m, you won't see anything from the top. If winds are above 40mph, the summit is unpleasant and potentially dangerous for beginners.

**The best days:** Clear, calm, dry. They happen — but you might need to be flexible on timing. Having a backup plan (Zip World, a castle visit, or [gorge walking](/snowdonia/things-to-do/gorge-walking) in a sheltered valley) means a bad weather day isn't a wasted day.

### Guided Walks

If you're nervous about navigation or conditions, a guided walk is a smart investment. Local mountain leaders know the routes intimately, handle all the navigation, and share fascinating local knowledge. They'll also make the call on weather — taking the pressure off you.

## The Smart Choice

Stick to the **Llanberis Path** on a **clear day**. Start early (before 8am in summer to beat crowds and secure parking at Pen y Pass or take the Sherpa bus from Llanberis). Take your time — there's no rush. Turn back if the weather closes in. And absolutely do not attempt Crib Goch on your first visit — it's a genuine knife-edge ridge where people die in bad conditions.

Snowdon is a brilliant achievement for a beginner. Just respect the mountain and come prepared. [Read our mountain safety guide](/safety/mountain-safety).
