  "introduction": "\"Walks\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in Snowdonia. It could mean a gentle stroll along a river to a waterfall, or it could mean eight hours battling heather and bogs on a remote ridge. This list covers the full range — from pushchair-friendly paths to full-day mountain routes.\n\nWe've deliberately weighted this towards walks that most people can actually do. There's a separate list for the best hikes if you want the big mountain stuff. Here, you'll find family-friendly waterfall trails alongside moderate hill walks that deliver proper views without requiring scrambling skills or a death wish.\n\nEvery walk on this list has been done in walking boots and in trainers (where appropriate), in sun and in sideways rain. That's the Snowdonia experience.",
  "rankingCriteria": "We favour walks that deliver maximum scenery for the effort required. Accessibility, path quality, parking, and how well they cope with crowds all factor in. A short walk that leaves you speechless beats a long one that merely tires you out.",

It's flat, easy, and delivers constant views of Snowdon's south face — arguably the mountain's most dramatic aspect.

      "question": "What's the best easy walk in Snowdonia?",
      "answer": "Cwm Idwal (#1) delivers the most dramatic scenery for the least effort. Aber Falls (#2) is even easier — a flat 2km path to a 37-metre waterfall. Both are suitable for families with young children."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there pushchair-friendly walks in Snowdonia?",
      "answer": "The Aber Falls path, Lôn Gwyrfai (#11), and the Mawddach Trail (#12) are all flat and well-surfaced enough for sturdy pushchairs. The first section of the Cwm Idwal path is also wheelchair-accessible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which Snowdonia walk is best in the rain?",
      "answer": "The Torrent Walk (#6) near Dolgellau is actually better in the rain — the enclosed gorge, moss-covered rocks, and swollen river are magical in wet weather. Waterfalls walks like Aber Falls (#2) and Swallow Falls (#9) also improve after rain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you walk in Snowdonia with dogs?",
      "answer": "Most walks on this list are dog-friendly. Keep dogs on leads around livestock (common in all areas) and during bird nesting season (March-July) near Cwm Idwal. The Beddgelert and Mawddach walks are particularly good for dogs."
