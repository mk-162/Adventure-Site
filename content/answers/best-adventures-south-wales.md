# What are the best adventure activities in South Wales?

## Quick Answer

South Wales is an adventure playground! For adrenaline junkies, try canyoning in the Brecon Beacons with 'Adventure Britain' or coasteering along the Gower Peninsula with 'Gower Adventures'. If you prefer something more relaxed, explore the scenic trails by bike in Afan Forest Park.

## Dive into Canyoning and Coasteering

South Wales offers some of the UK's best canyoning and coasteering. In the Brecon Beacons National Park, 'Adventure Britain', based near Ystradfellte, runs incredible canyoning trips through waterfalls and gorges, costing around £75-£95 per person. You'll be scrambling, jumping, and swimming – it's a proper adrenaline rush! Be aware that water levels can fluctuate, so check conditions beforehand, especially after heavy rain.

For a coastal adventure, head to the Gower Peninsula. 'Gower Adventures' in Swansea offers coasteering experiences that involve traversing rocky cliffs, exploring sea caves, and leaping into the sea. Expect to pay around £50-£70. Bracelet Bay and Pwlldu Bay are popular spots. Note that coasteering is tide-dependent, so trips are scheduled accordingly. Wetsuits and safety gear are provided, but bring sturdy shoes!

## Mountain Biking in Afan Forest Park

Afan Forest Park, near Port Talbot, is a world-class mountain biking destination. With trails ranging from beginner-friendly to seriously challenging, there's something for everyone. 'BikePark Wales' is nearby, offering uplift services for downhill riders, with day passes around £45.

Alternatively, explore the network of free trails, such as the 'Penhydd' trail (moderate) or the 'W2' trail (more challenging). Bike hire is available from several local shops, costing around £30-£40 per day. Be prepared for steep climbs and technical descents. The park can get busy on weekends, so arrive early.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Canyoning with Adventure Britain | Adrenaline junkies, groups | Strenuous | Brecon Beacons (Ystradfellte) |
| Coasteering with Gower Adventures | Coastal explorers, families | Moderate to Strenuous | Gower Peninsula (Swansea) |
| Mountain Biking in Afan Forest Park | All skill levels | Easy to Expert | Afan Forest (Port Talbot) |

## Practical Tips

- Download offline maps of Afan Forest Park before you go, as phone signal can be patchy.
- For canyoning, book well in advance, especially during peak season (summer). 'Adventure Britain' fills up quickly.
- Parking at popular Gower coasteering spots like Bracelet Bay can be a nightmare in summer. Arrive early or consider using public transport.
- Always check the weather forecast before heading out, and be prepared for sudden changes, especially in the Brecon Beacons.
