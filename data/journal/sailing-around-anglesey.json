  "content": "Anglesey offers some cracking sailing, whether you're a seasoned skipper or just finding your sea legs. This guide covers everything from bareboat charters to guided courses, so you can decide if braving the Menai Strait is for you.\n\n# Sailing Around Anglesey\n\nAnglesey, or *Ynys Môn* as we call it, is an island tailor-made for sailing. The coastline is stunningly varied, offering everything from sheltered bays to challenging open water. You've got the Menai Strait separating it from the mainland, dramatic cliffs on the north and west coasts, and calmer waters to the east. But be warned, this isn't the Med – expect changeable weather and strong tides.\n\n## Is Sailing Around Anglesey For You?\n\nRight, let's be straight. Sailing around Anglesey isn't a gentle paddle on a millpond. You need to be comfortable with:\n\n*   **Variable Weather:** Sunshine can turn to squalls in minutes. Pack layers, waterproofs are essential, and always check the forecast.\n*   **Strong Tides:** The Menai Strait in particular has some seriously strong currents. If you're not experienced navigating tides, stick to the eastern side of the island or consider a guided trip.\n*   **Rocky Coastline:** Anglesey's beauty comes with a price – plenty of rocks and reefs lurking just below the surface. Careful navigation is key.\n\nIf you're after a relaxing, predictable sail, maybe look at Llyn Peninsula instead – Abersoch is popular, but can be very crowded in peak season. Or consider the Norfolk Broads!\n\nBut, if you're up for a bit of a challenge, and the reward of stunning scenery and exhilarating sailing, Anglesey delivers in spades. This is proper sailing.\n\n## Where to Sail: Key Locations\n\n*   **Menai Strait:** This narrow channel separating Anglesey from the mainland offers sheltered sailing, but those infamous strong tides. Best for experienced sailors who know how to read the water. Watch out for the Swellies, a particularly treacherous section of rocks and whirlpools!\n*   **Beaumaris:** A historic town on the eastern side of the Strait. Good starting point for exploring the Strait. Plenty of mooring and marina facilities.\n*   **Holyhead:** The main port on the island, offering access to the open Irish Sea. Best suited for longer voyages.\n*   **Rhosneigr:** Popular for watersports, including sailing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing. Can be exposed to strong winds. Great for the experienced sailor.\n*   **Red Wharf Bay:** A vast, sandy bay on the east coast, offering relatively sheltered sailing. Good for beginners and families. Watch out for the tide going out – you could end up a long way from the water!\n\n## Options for Getting on the Water\n\n### Bareboat Charter\n\nIf you're a qualified skipper, you can charter a yacht and explore Anglesey at your own pace. Expect to pay around £1200-£3000 per week for a decent sized yacht (30-40 feet) during peak season (July/August) 2025. Out of season, you might find deals for £800 a week.\n\n*   **Pros:** Freedom to explore, tailor your itinerary.\n*   **Cons:** Requires qualifications and experience, responsibility for the boat.\n\n### Sailing Courses\n\nSeveral sailing schools offer courses for all levels, from complete beginners to experienced sailors looking to improve their skills.\n\n*   **Plas Menai** (near Llanfairpwllgwyngyll) offers a range of RYA (Royal Yachting Association) courses, from beginner courses like Competent Crew (£500 for a 5-day course in 2025) to advanced courses like Yachtmaster. They also offer powerboating and RIB boat rides, if sailing isn't your thing.\n*   **Other local providers** can be found online, prices varying based on duration and certification level.\n\n*   **Pros:** Learn from qualified instructors, gain valuable skills and certifications.\n*   **Cons:** Can be expensive, requires commitment of time.\n\n### Day Sails and Skippered Charters\n\nIf you want to experience sailing without the responsibility of skippering yourself, you can book a day sail or skippered charter. A local skipper will take you out for a day of sailing, showing you the best spots and handling the boat.\n\n*   **Availability:** Limited, search online for operators.\n*   **Cost:** Expect to pay around £100-£200 per person for a day sail.\n\n*   **Pros:** Relax and enjoy the scenery, learn from a local expert.\n*   **Cons:** Less freedom to choose your itinerary, dependent on skipper availability.\n\n## Practicalities\n\n*   **Getting There:** Anglesey is easily accessible by road (A55) and rail. Drive time from Chester is around 1 hour 30 minutes.\n*   **Parking:** Parking can be tricky, especially in popular coastal towns. Many car parks are pay-and-display, and can get very busy in summer. Be prepared to walk.\n*   **Accommodation:** Plenty of options, from campsites to hotels. Book well in advance, especially for peak season.\n*   **Weather:** As mentioned, the weather can be unpredictable. Check the forecast before you go, and be prepared for all conditions. The Met Office Coastal Waters forecast is your friend.\n*   **Tides:** Crucial for planning your sailing. Check tide tables before you go, and be aware of the tidal streams in the Menai Strait.\n\n## Safety Considerations\n\n*   **Always wear a lifejacket.** It's not cool to be macho about this.\n*   **Check the weather forecast before you go.**\n*   **Tell someone where you're going and when you expect to be back.**\n*   **Carry a VHF radio and know how to use it.**\n*   **Be aware of the tides and currents.**\n*   **Know your limitations.** Don't attempt anything beyond your skill level.\n*   **Carry flares and other safety equipment.**\n*   **Consider a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) for offshore sailing.**\n\n## Alternatives\n\nIf sailing feels a bit ambitious, don't write off Anglesey entirely. It's brilliant for [sea kayaking](region:anglesey), with tours often starting from Beaumaris or even Bull Bay. And if you prefer to stay on dry land, there's some excellent [hiking](tag:hiking) along the Anglesey Coastal Path. For a completely different perspective, head inland to explore the forests around Newborough.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nSailing around Anglesey is an unforgettable experience, but it's not for the faint of heart. With proper planning, preparation, and respect for the elements, you can enjoy some of the most rewarding sailing in Wales. Just remember to keep a close eye on the weather, the tides, and those pesky rocks! Now, anyone for a pint at the pub to discuss this further?",
