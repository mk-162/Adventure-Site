  "description": "St David's Day (Dydd Gŵyl Dewi Sant) on March 1st celebrates Wales' patron saint and national identity. Across Wales, communities mark the occasion with parades, concerts, eisteddfodau, and traditional festivities. Cardiff hosts the largest parade, while the tiny city of St Davids in Pembrokeshire offers intimate celebrations at the magnificent 12th-century cathedral built on the site where Dewi Sant established his monastery. Expect to see daffodils and leeks worn proudly, traditional Welsh costume, stirring male voice choirs, and the irresistible aroma of Welsh cakes. Many enjoy cawl (traditional lamb broth) and bara brith (speckled bread), embracing Dewi's famous words: 'Gwnewch y pethau bychain' - do the little things.",
