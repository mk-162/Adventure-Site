  "introduction": "Snowdonia is the scrambling capital of England and Wales. The combination of volcanic geology, glacial carving, and compact geography creates more quality scrambling routes per square mile than anywhere else south of Scotland.\n\nThis list covers Grades 1 to 3, which means everything from easy hands-on ridges to routes that border on rock climbing. Grade 1 means 'you'll want your hands for balance and confidence.' Grade 3 means 'one slip could kill you.' We've been explicit about grading because getting it wrong has real consequences.\n\nEvery route here has been done in ascent. Conditions matter enormously — dry rock is a different proposition to wet rock. A Grade 1 scramble in the rain can feel like a Grade 2. Do not attempt Grade 2+ routes in wet or icy conditions unless you're experienced and carrying a rope.",
  "rankingCriteria": "We've scrambled all of these routes multiple times in varying conditions. Rankings combine quality of scrambling (sustained hands-on movement), position and exposure, variety of moves, and the overall mountain experience. A short route with superb scrambling beats a long walk with a brief scramble.",

      "question": "What grade scramble should I start with in Snowdonia?",
      "answer": "Start with Tryfan North Ridge (#3) or Y Gribin (#6) — both are Grade 1 and give you a proper scrambling experience without extreme exposure. If you want something even gentler, Seniors Ridge (#7) is a shorter warm-up."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a rope for scrambling in Snowdonia?",
      "answer": "For Grade 1: no, but confident movement on rock is essential. For Grade 2: carry a 30m rope and slings as emergency backup. For Grade 3: you should be roping up for the hardest sections. If you're unsure, book a guided day."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I scramble in Snowdonia in the rain?",
      "answer": "Grade 1 routes (Tryfan, Y Gribin) are feasible in light rain on dry rock, but much harder and more dangerous. Grade 2 and above should not be attempted in wet conditions — the rock becomes extremely slippery. Always check MWIS before heading out."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between scrambling and walking in Snowdonia?",
      "answer": "Walking uses your feet; scrambling uses your hands too. Grade 1 means occasional hand use for balance. Grade 3 means one slip could kill you and a rope should be used. The transition from walking to scrambling catches many people out — it's a genuine step up in risk and commitment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Crib Goch harder than Tryfan North Ridge?",
      "answer": "The scrambling on Crib Goch is actually simpler than Tryfan (Grade 1 vs Grade 1), but the exposure is incomparably greater. Tryfan is more technically demanding in terms of route-finding and hand placements. Crib Goch is more psychologically demanding due to the knife-edge ridge and sheer drops. Different challenges entirely."
