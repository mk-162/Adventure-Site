It covers costs, difficulties, and honest opinions to help you decide if it's for you.\n\n# We Tried the Snowdonia Adventure Weekend — Here's What Happened\n\nRight, so we decided to tackle a Snowdonia adventure weekend. Two mates, a car full of gear, and a vague plan – what could possibly go wrong? Plenty, as it turned out, but mostly in a good way. I'll break down what we did, what it cost, and whether I'd recommend it.\n\n## Day 1: Tackling Snowdon\n\nWe figured a hike up Snowdon was a must, being in Snowdonia and all. We opted for the Llanberis Path. Why? Because we’re honest with ourselves, and neither of us fancied Crib Goch after a week at the office. That's one for experienced scramblers, and you'll want a guide, like MountainXperience, for that – expect to pay £55-75. We also contemplated going with Snowdonia Mountain Guides for a Llanberis Path guided walk, but figured it looked straightforward enough. It is…mostly.\n\n### The Llanberis Grind\n\nParking in Llanberis is a nightmare, especially in summer. Get there early. We managed to snag a spot in the main car park (about £6 for the day) around 8am. Otherwise, you’re looking at parking further out and adding to the already long slog.\n\nThe Llanberis Path itself is relentlessly…uphill. It's the longest and gentlest route to the summit, but don't let that fool you. It’s still a proper hike. The views are, as you’d expect, stunning. You can see across Anglesey on a clear day. We didn’t get a clear day. We got drizzle, then cloud, then full-on Welsh mist.\n\n### Summit Blues (and Reds)\n\nThe summit café was closed for refurbishment (typical!), so we were glad we'd packed sandwiches and flasks. The views from the top were…non-existent. Just grey, wet, and a whole lot of wind. Be prepared for the weather to change in minutes up there. We saw people in t-shirts shivering their way back down; fools. Decent waterproofs and layers are essential, even in summer. I've seen snow up there in July.\n\nThe descent was brutal on the knees. Poles would have been a good idea. We were both hobbling by the time we got back to Llanberis. Total time: about 6 hours, including a very brief stop at the top.\n\n### Post-Hike Reward\n\nAfterwards, we headed back to our accommodation, a perfectly acceptable but basic Airbnb in Nant Peris (about £80 a night). Showered, changed, and drove to Llanberis for a well-deserved pint.\n\n*   **Verdict:** Snowdon via Llanberis Path is a solid day out. It’s *moderate* in difficulty, but long. Suitable for most reasonably fit people. Just be prepared for any weather. If you want something more challenging, consider the Miner’s Track or Pyg Track. If you hate walking uphill, maybe try the Snowdon Mountain Railway (book well in advance). Total cost for the day (excluding accommodation): £6 parking, £15 for lunch/snacks, £5 for the celebratory pint.\n*   **Tags:** hiking, mountain, moderate, free-parking\n\n## Day 2: Gorge Walking and Flying Through the Air\n\nDay two was all about adrenaline. We booked a gorge walking session with Adventure Britain.\n\n### Plunging into the Gorge\n\nWe met our instructor near Betws-y-Coed. The location depends on the weather and water levels, but it was about a 20-minute drive. The gorge walking itself was fantastic. We were kitted out with wetsuits, helmets, and buoyancy aids. The water was freezing, even in July, but you soon get used to it.\n\nThe session involved scrambling over rocks, wading through pools, and jumping off small waterfalls. Nothing too extreme, but enough to get the heart pumping. Adventure Britain are brilliant - really safety-conscious, but also made it a proper laugh. The gorge we went to had a few chest-deep sections, so you need to be able to swim.\n\n### Zip World Velocity 2\n\nAfterwards, we headed to Penrhyn Quarry near Bethesda for Zip World Velocity 2. This is the big one – the fastest zip line in the world, apparently. It’s not cheap (£89-£109, depending on the time of day and day of the week), but it's an experience.\n\nThe whole process is slick and efficient. You get kitted out, briefed, and then taken up to the top of the quarry in a truck. The views from up there are incredible, even on a cloudy day.\n\nThen comes the zip line. It’s terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure. You accelerate to speeds of over 100 mph in seconds. It's over far too quickly, but the adrenaline rush lasts for hours.\n\n### Costs and Considerations\n\n*   **Gorge Walking:** £75 per person with Adventure Britain. Includes all equipment.\n*   **Zip World Velocity 2:** £99 per person (we went mid-week). Booking essential.\n*   **Parking at Zip World:** Free.\n\n*   **Verdict:** Gorge walking is a great way to experience Snowdonia’s rivers. Suitable for most fitness levels. Velocity 2 is expensive, but worth it if you’re an adrenaline junkie. If you’re scared of heights, skip it. Also, if you have younger kids, consider Zip World Fforest Coaster instead – a toboggan run through the woods that's still a good thrill. Or Bounce Below if the weather isn't good, which is always a distinct possibility.\n*   **Tags:** gorge-walking, zip-lining, moderate, equipment-provided, wetsuit-provided, guided, free-parking\n\n## What I'd Do Differently\n\n*   **Check the weather forecast properly.** We relied too much on the BBC Weather app, which wasn’t accurate for the mountain. Mountain Forecast is a better bet.\n*   **Book accommodation further in advance.** We left it late and ended up with a mediocre Airbnb.\n*   **Take walking poles for the Snowdon descent.** My knees are still complaining.\n\n## Other Snowdonia Adventures to Consider\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Snowdonia, there's more to do than just climb Snowdon and fling yourself off a quarry.\n\n*   **Mountain Biking at Coed y Brenin:** World-class trails for all abilities. Parking costs £2-7, and there's everything from family-friendly routes to challenging downhill sections.\n*   **Sea Kayaking with Plas y Brenin:** Explore the coastline from a different perspective. They offer courses and guided tours for all levels.\n*   **Explore North Wales Coast:** Check out Llandudno, Conwy, or maybe even a little further afield to Anglesey.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nOverall, our Snowdonia adventure weekend was a success, despite the weather and the aching knees. It's a fantastic region for outdoor activities, with something to suit everyone. Just be prepared for anything the Welsh weather throws at you, and book in advance!",
