  "introduction": "Snowdonia. Eryri. Call it what you will, this corner of North Wales is a hiker's paradise, no arguments. Forget manicured trails and gentle strolls; here, the mountains bite back. We're talking proper peaks, scrambling ridges, and views that'll stop you dead in your tracks. \n\nSnowdon (Yr Wyddfa) inevitably hogs the limelight, and rightly so. Six different routes offer varying levels of challenge, from the relatively gentle Llanberis Path to the exposed Crib Goch, a knife-edge arete only for those with a head for heights. But don't let Snowdon overshadow the rest. Tryfan's iconic North Ridge is a classic scramble, Cadair Idris offers solitude and stunning vistas, and the Glyderau are just plain weird, all jagged rocks and otherworldly landscapes.\n\nHiking in Snowdonia isn't always a walk in the park (literally). The weather can change in an instant, navigation can be tricky, and some routes demand serious scrambling skills. But that's the appeal, right? This is a place to test yourself, to earn those summit views, and to refuel with a well-deserved pint in a cosy pub afterwards. It's best suited for those with a decent level of fitness and some experience of hill walking. Beginners can find plenty of easier trails, but even those should be approached with respect. Come prepared, respect the mountains, and Snowdonia will reward you with memories that last a lifetime. Just remember to pack your waterproofs… and maybe a compass.",
