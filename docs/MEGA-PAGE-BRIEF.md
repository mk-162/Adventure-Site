# Mega Landing Pages — Strategy Brief

## The Principle

Google rewards the **single best page on the internet** for a query. Not the best _site_ — the best _page_. For ultra-high-volume keyphrases like "zip lining" or "climbing Snowdon", we need pages so comprehensive, so rich in data, media, and social proof that no competitor can match them.

These aren't blog posts. They aren't thin landing pages. They're **mega pages** — living, breathing, constantly-updated authority documents that aggregate everything a searcher could possibly want into one URL.

---

## Target Keyphrases

### Selection Criteria
Only build mega pages for keyphrases that are:
- **High volume** (10k+ monthly searches UK)
- **High commercial intent** (people searching = people wanting to book/do)
- **Winnable** — we can realistically be the best page (activity + Wales connection helps)
- **Evergreen** — not seasonal spikes, but year-round demand

### Initial Candidates
| Keyphrase | Est. UK Monthly Vol | Why We Win |
|---|---|---|
| zip lining / zip lining wales | 30k+ | Velocity at Zip World = world's fastest. Wales owns this. |
| climbing Snowdon / walk up Snowdon | 50k+ | Literally the most searched mountain in Wales |
| coasteering | 15k+ | Pembrokeshire = birthplace of coasteering |
| mountain biking wales | 10k+ | BikePark Wales, Coed y Brenin, Afan — globally famous |
| surfing wales | 8k+ | Gower, Pembrokeshire, Llŷn — growing scene |

_Expand this list as the site grows. Any keyphrase where Wales is genuinely world-class = mega page candidate._

## Anatomy of a Mega Page

Every mega page follows the same structural blueprint. The goal: **zero reason to hit the back button**.

### 1. Hero & Hook (above the fold)
- **Full-bleed hero image** — the single most stunning photo of this activity in Wales. Professional quality, unique to us if possible.
- **H1** — exact match keyphrase, natural language. "Zip Lining in Wales" or "Climbing Snowdon: The Complete Guide"
- **Hook paragraph** — 2-3 sentences. Why Wales, why this page, what you'll find. Written with authority.
- **Quick-answer box** — the Google snippet target. Key stats in a scannable card:
  - Best time to go
  - Price range
  - Difficulty level
  - Duration
  - Best for (families / couples / adrenaline junkies)
- **Jump nav / table of contents** — sticky sidebar or top bar. Every section linkable.

### 2. The Definitive Guide (2,000–4,000 words editorial)
This is the meat. Written by someone who's done it, not someone who's Googled it.

#### Structure:
- **What is it?** — 100-word explainer for total beginners
- **Why Wales?** — what makes Wales THE place for this activity (history, geography, world records, unique features)
- **The experiences** — every venue/route/location, grouped logically:
  - For zip lining: every zip line in Wales (Velocity, Titan, Fforest, etc.) with specs, prices, what makes each unique
  - For Snowdon: every route (Llanberis Path, Miners' Track, Pyg Track, Watkin Path, Rhyd Ddu, Snowdon Ranger, Crib Goch) with difficulty, duration, what to expect
- **Seasonal guide** — month-by-month breakdown. When's best, when to avoid, what changes
- **Who's it for?** — families, groups, solo, accessibility, age restrictions
- **What to bring / wear** — gear checklist, layering advice, specific to Wales weather
- **Getting there** — transport for every venue. Parking, public transport, nearest station
- **Cost breakdown** — every price point, group discounts, combo deals, free alternatives if they exist

### 3. Every Operator & Venue (structured data goldmine)
A card/grid for every single business offering this activity in Wales. **This is our directory — we list everyone, and operators who pay get enhanced and promoted.**

#### Standard Listing (free — every operator gets this):
- Business name
- Location (with map pin)
- Price range
- What they offer (brief)
- Link to their operator page on our site

#### Enhanced Listing (paid tier):
- Everything in standard, PLUS:
- Logo displayed prominently
- TripAdvisor / Google rating badge
- Unique selling point callout (1 line, written by us or approved)
- Photo gallery (their best 2-3 images)
- Book now CTA (direct link / affiliate)
- Opening hours / seasonality
- Special offers / discount codes
- Extended description

#### Promoted Listing (premium tier):
- Everything in enhanced, PLUS:
- **Pinned to top of operator grid** with "Featured" badge
- **Highlighted card** (subtle visual distinction — border/background)
- **Expanded card** — larger format, more photos, video embed
- **Mentioned in editorial** — natural integration into the guide text ("One of the standout operators is...")
- **FAQ sponsorship** — "Answered by [Operator]" on relevant FAQs
- **Map prominence** — larger/coloured pin on interactive map

#### Commercial Model:
- **We control the directory.** Every operator in Wales doing this activity gets listed — that's what makes the page comprehensive and authoritative.
- **Paying operators get more visibility.** Enhanced listings, top placement, editorial mentions, bigger cards. The page stays editorially honest — we don't hide bad operators or fake rankings — but commercial partners get the spotlight.
- **Revenue streams per mega page:**
  - Enhanced listing fee (monthly/annual)
  - Promoted/featured placement (monthly/annual, limited spots per page)
  - Affiliate commission on bookings driven from the page
  - Page sponsorship (single brand owns the "presented by" slot)
- **Pricing scales with traffic.** As the page ranks higher and drives more traffic, listing value increases.

#### Why this matters:
- Structured data (LocalBusiness schema) for every venue = Google loves it
- Users compare without leaving the page
- Comprehensive directory = best page on the internet (the SEO play)
- Tiered listings = scalable revenue without compromising content quality

### 4. Video Hub
**This is a massive differentiator.** Most competitor pages have zero or one video.

#### What to embed:
- **YouTube videos** — curated best-of. Search "[activity] wales" on YouTube, embed the top 10-20 relevant videos
  - POV / first-person experience videos
  - Drone footage
  - Review/vlog videos from creators
  - Official operator promo videos
  - "What to expect" walkthrough videos
- **TikTok embeds** — viral clips, short-form content
- **Our own video** (when we have it) — always position first

#### Organisation:
- Group by sub-topic (e.g., for Snowdon: one video section per route)
- Add a 1-2 sentence editorial comment per video ("This POV from the Crib Goch ridge shows exactly why it's not for beginners")
- Create a "Video Guide" section header so it's findable via jump nav

### 5. Social Wall (Safe Version)
Real social proof = E-E-A-T signals. We curate and store social content ourselves — no fragile platform embeds that can break.

#### What we store (per item):
- **Quote text** — short excerpt (1-2 sentences max)
- **Author name** — display name, not handle (unless well-known)
- **Platform** — twitter, instagram, tripadvisor, google, reddit, tiktok, facebook
- **Source URL** — link to the original post (always link back)
- **Date** — when the original was posted
- **Content type** — review, photo_credit, quote, recommendation, tip
- **Optional image URL** — only if we have permission or it's the operator's own content
- **Operator link** — if the post mentions a specific operator, link to them

#### What's legally safe:
- ✅ Short text quotes with attribution + link to original
- ✅ Paraphrased summaries of longer posts
- ✅ Operator-submitted content (they'll happily give permission)
- ✅ Review excerpts (1-2 lines with "via TripAdvisor" + link)
- ✅ YouTube/TikTok embeds via official embed code (Section 4 covers these)
- ❌ No screenshots of tweets/posts
- ❌ No reproducing full posts
- ❌ No using someone's photos without permission

#### How to display:
- **Social wall** — masonry card grid, each card shows: quote, author, platform icon, link to original
- **"What people are saying"** section header
- Cards styled per platform (subtle colour/icon — TripAdvisor green, Google blue, Reddit orange)
- **Star ratings aggregate** — "Rated 4.8/5 across 2,340 reviews" (aggregate from all operators)
- Minimum 10 social items per mega page at launch, grow over time

#### Sourcing social content:
1. Search TripAdvisor/Google for each operator — pull best 1-line quotes
2. Search Reddit for activity + location discussions — quote useful tips
3. Search X/Twitter for activity mentions — quote short reactions
4. Ask operators directly: "Can we feature your social posts?" (most say yes)
5. Over time: invite users to submit their own quotes/tips via the site

### 6. Maps & Location Data
Interactive, not just a static image.

- **Custom map** showing every venue/route/location mentioned on the page
- **Clickable pins** — tap a pin, see the venue card
- **Route overlays** — for hiking/cycling, show the actual GPX routes on the map
- **Nearby:** accommodation, food, parking, train stations
- **Multiple map views** if the activity spans Wales (overview map + zoomed detail maps per area)

### 7. Practical Planning Tools
Make the page genuinely useful, not just informational.

- **Weather widget** — live conditions at key locations
- **Booking comparison** — if multiple operators offer similar experiences, let users compare
- **"Plan your trip" CTA** — link to relevant itineraries on our site
- **Packing checklist** — downloadable/printable
- **Cost calculator** — "2 adults + 2 kids doing X = approximately £Y"
- **Difficulty comparator** — visual scale comparing all options on the page
- **Calendar/availability hints** — "Book 2-3 weeks ahead in summer" etc.

### 8. FAQ Section (Schema-marked)
Target People Also Ask and voice search.

#### Sources for FAQs:
- Google's "People Also Ask" for the keyphrase — answer every single one
- Reddit/forum questions about this activity
- TripAdvisor Q&A sections
- Common operator FAQ pages
- Our own knowledge

#### Format:
- Question exactly as people ask it ("Can you climb Snowdon in winter?")
- Answer: concise first sentence (the snippet target), then expand with detail
- Mark up with FAQPage schema — this directly generates SERP features

#### Volume:
- Minimum 15 FAQs per mega page
- Group into sub-categories if needed (Before You Go / On the Day / After)

### 9. Related Content & Internal Linking
Keep people on the site. Feed the crawler.

- **Related activity pages** — "If you liked zip lining, try coasteering"
- **Region pages** — "Explore more of Snowdonia"
- **Itineraries featuring this activity** — "Weekend zip lining trip" etc.
- **Journal articles** — any blog posts we've written about this
- **Seasonal/event tie-ins** — "Zip lining at night — Halloween special"
- **Breadcrumbs** — full path back to home

### 10. Schema Markup (Non-Negotiable)
Every mega page must have:
- `FAQPage` — all FAQs
- `LocalBusiness` — every operator listed
- `BreadcrumbList` — navigation path
- `Article` or `WebPage` — with author, datePublished, dateModified
- `AggregateRating` — if we aggregate reviews
- `HowTo` — if applicable (e.g., "How to climb Snowdon")
- `VideoObject` — for every embedded video
- `ImageObject` — for hero and key images
- `Place` — for locations mentioned
- `Event` — if seasonal events are listed
- `Product`/`Offer` — for bookable experiences with prices

---

## Commercial Strategy

**Every mega page is a revenue asset.** The traffic these pages attract is high-intent — people actively planning to do an activity. That makes every page valuable to operators.

### Revenue Layers Per Mega Page
| Revenue Stream | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Enhanced listings** | Monthly/annual fee per operator | £X/month to upgrade from standard → enhanced |
| **Promoted placement** | Monthly/annual, limited to 3 per page | Top of grid + editorial mention |
| **Page sponsor** | Single sponsor, "Presented by" | One brand per mega page |
| **Affiliate bookings** | Commission per booking click-through | Track via UTM/affiliate links |
| **Display/native ads** | CPM or flat monthly | Tasteful, relevant, non-intrusive |

### Sales Approach
1. **Build the page first.** Get it ranking. Get traffic flowing.
2. **Show operators their listing.** "You're already on our zip lining guide — here's your current listing."
3. **Pitch the upgrade.** "2,000 people a month see this page. Want to be at the top with photos, reviews, and a booking button?"
4. **Proof in the data.** Share click-through stats, booking referrals, ranking position.

### Pricing Philosophy
- Standard listing is always free — this keeps the page comprehensive
- Enhanced/promoted pricing scales with page traffic (low at launch, increases as rankings improve)
- Annual deals with discount vs monthly
- Bundle deals across multiple mega pages

## Build Process

### Phase 1: Research Sprint (per page)
1. **Keyword mapping** — primary, secondary, long-tail, local intent, questions
2. **Competitor audit** — screenshot and analyse current top 5 results
3. **Content harvesting** — run through the sourcing playbook above
4. **Data collection** — every operator, every price, every review score
5. **Media gathering** — images, videos, social embeds. Catalogue everything.

### Phase 2: Content Creation
1. **Write the editorial** — 2,000-4,000 words, expert voice, genuinely useful
2. **Build operator cards** — structured data for every venue
3. **Curate videos** — select and annotate best YouTube/TikTok content
4. **Write FAQs** — answer every People Also Ask question
5. **Create/source maps** — custom interactive maps with all locations

### Phase 3: Technical Build
1. **Page template** — reusable mega page component (build once, use for all)
2. **Schema markup** — all structured data types
3. **Performance** — lazy load videos/images, critical CSS above fold
4. **Jump nav** — smooth scroll to any section
5. **Mobile** — must be exceptional on mobile (most adventure searches are mobile)

### Phase 4: Launch & Amplify
1. **Internal linking** — link to mega page from every relevant page on site
2. **Social sharing** — share sections/stats on social channels
3. **Outreach** — reach out to operators featured (they'll share/link)
4. **Monitor** — track rankings weekly, iterate content based on what Google rewards

### Phase 5: Keep It Alive
- **Monthly content refresh** — update prices, add new reviews, new videos
- **Quarterly deep refresh** — rewrite sections that aren't performing, add new operators
- **Evergreen freshness signals** — "Last updated: [date]" prominently displayed
- **User contributions** — enable reviews/photos/trip reports from visitors

## Keyphrase Identification — How to Find the Pages Worth Building

### Step 1: Seed List
Start with what you know. Wales is world-class in specific activities — those are your mega page candidates:
- Activities where Wales holds records or firsts (zip lining, coasteering)
- Activities with iconic Welsh locations (Snowdon, Pembrokeshire coast, Brecon Beacons)
- Activities with year-round demand (not one-off events)

### Step 2: Validate with Search Data
For each candidate, check:
1. **Google autocomplete** — type the activity name. Does Google suggest Wales-related variants?
2. **People Also Ask** — are there PAA boxes? More boxes = more demand
3. **Google Trends** — check `[activity] wales` for search trend. Is it consistent or growing?
4. **Competitor check** — who ranks #1-3? Is it a big authority (Wikipedia, Lonely Planet) or a beatable site?
5. **SERP features** — are there featured snippets, video carousels, local packs? These are signals Google considers this a rich topic worth deep content.

### Step 3: Score and Prioritise
Rate each candidate on:
| Factor | Score 1-5 |
|---|---|
| Search volume (UK monthly) | 1=<1k, 5=50k+ |
| Commercial intent (people wanting to book/do) | 1=informational only, 5=ready to buy |
| Wales dominance (are we THE place for this?) | 1=we're one of many, 5=we're the world leader |
| Winnability (can we realistically outrank current #1?) | 1=impossible (Wikipedia), 5=weak competition |
| Operator coverage (do we have operators in DB?) | 1=none, 5=comprehensive |

**Build mega pages in score order, highest first.**

### Step 4: Ongoing Discovery
- Monitor Google Search Console for queries driving impressions to existing pages — if a keyphrase gets 10k+ impressions but we don't have a mega page, that's a signal
- Check what competitors are building mega pages for
- Watch for trending activities (e.g., wild swimming surged in recent years)

---

### Operator Tier Management

#### On the operator record (`/admin/content/operators/[id]`)
Add a new section: **"Mega Page Listings"**
- Shows every mega page this operator appears on
- Their tier on each page (standard / enhanced / promoted)
- Quick-change tier dropdown per page

#### Global tier rules (existing `billingTier` on operators table):
| billingTier | What they get across ALL pages |
|---|---|
| `free` | Standard listing everywhere — name, location, link to their operator page |
| `verified` | Enhanced on all pages — logo, ratings, USP, photos, booking CTA |
| `premium` | Enhanced everywhere + eligible for promoted placement (promoted still assigned per-page in admin) |

#### Per-page tier override:
- An operator on `free` globally can still be `promoted` on one specific mega page (if they pay for just that page)
- The mega page editor (Tab 3) controls per-page overrides
- Per-page override always wins over global tier

## The Non-Negotiable Standard

Before publishing any mega page, it must pass this test:

> **"If someone searching this keyphrase lands on our page, is there ANY reason they'd need to visit another website?"**

If the answer is yes — the page isn't done yet.

Every fact. Every operator. Every video. Every question answered. Every photo that inspires. Every practical detail that helps someone actually do the thing.

That's how you become Google's #1 result. Not by gaming the algorithm — by genuinely being the best page on the internet.
