# Image Sourcing Brief — Sport/Location Pages

## The Problem

The sport/location pages need stunning, authentic Welsh images. Generic stock photos won't cut it — these pages need to scream "this is ACTUALLY Snowdonia" or "this is ACTUALLY Pembrokeshire". Users can tell the difference between a stock photo of a random mountain and a real shot of Crib Goch.

## What We Need Per Page

Each sport/location combo page needs:

| Image Type | Count | Size | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| Hero image | 1 | 1920×1080 | Full-width header, the money shot |
| Spot/route images | 5-10 | 1200×800 | One per featured spot |
| Gallery images | 6-10 | 1200×800 | Mixed content grid |
| **Total per page** | **12-21** | | |

With 10 Tier 1 pages, that's **120-210 images** needed for the first batch alone.

## Image Quality Standards

### Must Have
- **Actually Wales** — real Welsh locations, not "generic mountains"
- **Recognisable** — a local should be able to say "that's Tryfan" or "that's Rhossili"
- **High resolution** — minimum 1200px wide, prefer 1920px+
- **Good light** — golden hour, dramatic clouds, NOT flat grey overcast (unless it suits the mood)
- **People doing the activity** — action shots where possible, not just landscapes
- **Seasonal variety** — don't make everything look like July

### Avoid
- Generic stock photos of random mountains/beaches
- Watermarked images
- Low resolution or heavily compressed
- AI-generated images of specific real locations (they get details wrong)
- Overly processed/HDR images that look fake

### Step 2: Flickr CC Search
```
Search: "{activity} {region}" OR "{specific spot name}"
Filter: CC BY or CC BY-SA (licence 4 or 5)
Sort: Relevance or Interestingness
```

## How to Store & Deliver Images

### File Naming
```
/images/combo/{region}-{activity}-hero.jpg           — hero
/images/combo/{region}-{activity}-{spot-slug}.jpg     — per spot
/images/combo/{region}-{activity}-{nn}-{8char-hash}.jpg — gallery
```

### Attribution Tracking
Add to `/public/images/attributions.json` (existing file):

```json
{
  "images/combo/snowdonia-hiking-hero.jpg": {
    "source": "flickr",
    "photographer": "John Smith",
    "photographerUrl": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnsmith/",
    "originalUrl": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnsmith/12345678/",
    "licence": "CC BY 2.0",
    "licenceUrl": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/",
    "description": "Hikers on the Llanberis Path with Snowdon summit ahead",
    "downloadedAt": "2025-02"
  }
}
```

**Every image MUST have an attribution entry.** No exceptions. Even Unsplash (where attribution isn't legally required) — track the source for our records.

### Image Processing
Before adding to the repo:

1. **Resize** to target dimensions (1920×1080 hero, 1200×800 spots/gallery)
2. **Optimise** — target <200KB for spots/gallery, <400KB for heroes
3. **Strip EXIF** data (privacy)
4. **Convert** to JPEG if not already
5. **Generate hash** for filename: first 8 chars of MD5 of the file

### Quality Check
Before using any image, verify:

- [ ] Is this actually the correct location in Wales?
- [ ] Is the resolution high enough?
- [ ] Is the licence compatible with commercial use?
- [ ] Is the attribution recorded in `attributions.json`?
- [ ] Does the image show the right activity?
- [ ] Is the image well-lit and visually appealing?
- [ ] No watermarks, no logos, no identifiable faces without consent?

## Priority Order

Match the Tier 1 combo pages:

1. **Hiking in Snowdonia** — easiest, most images available
2. **Surfing in Pembrokeshire** — good coverage on Flickr/Unsplash
3. **Coasteering in Pembrokeshire** — harder, may need operator images
4. **Climbing in Snowdonia** — good Flickr coverage (Tryfan, Idwal)
5. **Surfing in Gower** — Llangennith is well-photographed
6. **Zip Lining in Snowdonia** — Zip World has press images
7. **Hiking in Brecon Beacons** — Pen y Fan is everywhere
8. **MTB in Snowdonia** — Coed y Brenin coverage decent
9. **Kayaking in Pembrokeshire** — sea kayak shots needed
10. **Gorge Walking in Snowdonia** — hardest, very niche activity

## Flickr API Quick Reference

If automating image search, use the Flickr API:

```

## Summary

Don't rely on one source. The best pages will mix:
- **Visit Wales** for dramatic hero landscapes
- **Flickr CC** for specific locations and action shots
- **Unsplash/Pexels** for atmosphere and gap-filling
- **Wikimedia** for specific named locations
- **Operators** for authentic action photography

Track everything in `attributions.json`. No unattributed images on the site.
