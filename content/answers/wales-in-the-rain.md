# Is It Always Raining in Wales?

## Quick Answer

No. But it rains more than most of England, and it can rain at any time of year with zero notice. The western mountains (Snowdonia) get the worst of it — Snowdon's summit sees over 4,000mm of rain per year, making it one of the wettest places in the UK. Pembrokeshire's coast is significantly drier. The honest answer: pack waterproofs, plan for rain, and be pleasantly surprised when the sun comes out. Because when it does, Wales is spectacular.

## The Detail

### The Numbers

*   **Snowdonia mountains:** 3,000-4,500mm per year. That's genuinely wet — three to four times the UK average.
*   **Pembrokeshire coast:** 900-1,100mm per year. Actually drier than many parts of England.
*   **Brecon Beacons:** 1,500-2,500mm depending on altitude.
*   **Coastal towns (Tenby, Aberystwyth):** 900-1,200mm — perfectly manageable.

The pattern is clear: altitude = rain. Coastal = drier. Valleys = somewhere in between.

### Month by Month

*   **January-March:** Wet and cold. The wettest period in the mountains. Shorter days mean less time to dodge the showers.
*   **April-May:** Improving. April can still be wet but May is often one of the driest months. Spring sunshine in Pembrokeshire can be genuinely glorious.
*   **June-August:** The driest period, but "dry" is relative. You'll get rain in every summer month. July and August average 10-14 rainy days. The good news: summer rain often comes in showers rather than day-long downpours, so you can work around it.
*   **September-October:** September is often excellent — late summer warmth without the crowds. October gets wetter as autumn storms arrive.
*   **November-December:** Wet, windy, and dark. But atmospheric, and the mountains in winter are extraordinary.

### What the Rain Actually Means

Welsh rain isn't always the torrential downpour you might imagine. It's often:
*   **Drizzle:** Persistent, fine rain that doesn't seem like much but soaks you through if you're not wearing waterproofs. The Snowdonia speciality.
*   **Passing showers:** Especially in summer. Rain moves through, sun appears, repeat. Having waterproofs you can throw on and off is key.
*   **Horizontal rain:** In the mountains with wind. This is the one that gets people. Wind-driven rain defeats inadequate waterproofs quickly.
*   **Biblical downpours:** Less common but real. Usually short-lived. The waterfalls look incredible afterwards.

## What to Do When It Rains

Rain doesn't have to ruin your trip. Some activities are better in the rain:

*   **[Caving](/activities/caving):** Underground, constant 10°C, completely rain-proof. The Brecon Beacons caves are a perfect wet-weather option.
*   **Zip World underground attractions:** Bounce Below and Zip World Caverns in Blaenau Ffestiniog run rain or shine. [Find zip lines in Snowdonia](/snowdonia/things-to-do/zip-lining).
*   **Castles:** Caernarfon, Conwy, Harlech, Caerphilly — all impressive in the rain. Atmospheric, even.
*   **[Gorge walking](/activities/gorge-walking):** You're getting wet anyway. Rain makes the waterfalls more impressive.
*   **[Coasteering](/activities/coasteering):** Already in the sea. Light rain makes no difference.
*   **Museums and galleries:** The National Slate Museum (Llanberis), St Fagans National Museum of History (Cardiff), and the National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth) are all excellent.
*   **Pubs:** Wales has genuinely fantastic pubs. A rainy afternoon in a proper Welsh pub with a fire, a pint, and a pie is not wasted time.

## The Smart Choice

Don't avoid Wales because of the rain — you'd miss out on one of the most beautiful parts of the UK. Instead: pack a proper waterproof jacket (sealed seams, not a fashion rain coat), bring waterproof trousers, and plan each day with a mix of outdoor and indoor options. Check the Met Office forecast each morning and be flexible. The people who enjoy Wales most are the ones who stop fighting the weather and start working with it.
