# What is the Best Time to Visit Pembrokeshire?

## Quick Answer

The best time to visit Pembrokeshire depends on your priorities. For the warmest weather and best chance of sunshine for activities like coasteering, surfing, and sea kayaking, **July and August** are ideal. However, if you prefer fewer crowds and don't mind slightly cooler temperatures, **late spring (May-June) or early autumn (September)** offer a great balance of pleasant weather and quieter beaches.

## Pembrokeshire's Peak Season: July & August

Pembrokeshire comes alive in July and August. This is when you'll find:

*   **Warmest Temperatures:** Average highs reach the low 20s Celsius (low 70s Fahrenheit), perfect for swimming and watersports.
*   **Longest Daylight Hours:** Maximize your time exploring the coastline and enjoying outdoor adventures.
*   **Busiest Beaches & Attractions:** Expect larger crowds and book accommodations and activities well in advance. Operators like TYF Adventure, Preseli Venture, and Activity Pembrokeshire are very busy at this time.
*   **Vibrant Atmosphere:** Festivals, events, and a bustling holiday vibe.

## Shoulder Seasons: May-June & September

For a sweet spot between good weather and fewer crowds, consider the shoulder seasons:

*   **May & June:** Wildflowers are in bloom, the weather is generally pleasant, and the sea starts to warm up. It's a great time for hiking the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and wildlife boat tours to Ramsey Island with Preseli Venture.
*   **September:** The sea is still relatively warm from the summer, the crowds have thinned out, and you can often enjoy sunny days. This is a perfect month for coasteering with Tenby Adventure or MUUK Adventures and surfing lessons with Outer Reef Surf School.
