    "full": "Skydiving Snowdonia operates from the historic Llanbedr Airfield in the heart of Snowdonia National Park, offering what many consider to be the most spectacular skydiving views in the UK. With Mount Snowdon standing at 3,560ft and jumps taking place from 7,000ft to 13,000ft, you'll literally be flying above Wales' highest mountain.\n\nThe location is simply breathtaking. Even the flight up gives you terrific views of Mount Snowdon and the Snowdonia National Park, the coast of Cardigan Bay, the Llŷn Peninsula, and on exceptionally clear days, you can even see across to Ireland. During freefall and your parachute descent, you're treated to unparalleled 360-degree views of this stunning part of Wales.\n\nLlanbedr Airfield has a rich aviation history, historically owned by the military and used as a training airfield for fast jet pilots from RAF Valley on Anglesey. Today it's under the control of Snowdonia Aerospace LLP and serves as a base for various aviation activities including Whizzard Helicopters who offer helicopter tours and flights.\n\nThe area surrounding the dropzone is perfect for a weekend adventure. There's a range of local accommodation from campsites to hotels, a café/bistro on the airfield, plenty of parking, and the beaches in the area are fantastic - perfect for relaxing after the exhilaration of your skydive. The coastal towns of Barmouth and Harlech are nearby, along with countless walking trails and outdoor activities.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Due to British Skydiving requirements, operations are currently suspended until a Chief Instructor can be appointed. Check the website or call before booking.**"
