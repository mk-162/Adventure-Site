# What Should I Expect on My First Gorge Walk?

## Quick Answer

Gorge walking (also called canyoning or ghyll scrambling) involves descending a river gorge by walking, scrambling, swimming, sliding, and jumping through waterfalls and pools. You'll wear a wetsuit, helmet, and buoyancy aid while an instructor guides you through a spectacular natural water park. It's wet, exhilarating, and suitable for beginners — expect to get completely soaked and to grin all day.

## What Actually Happens

### Before You Start
1. **Meet at the base** — Usually a car park or outdoor centre
2. **Get kitted up** — Full wetsuit, helmet, buoyancy aid (all provided)
3. **Safety briefing** — Techniques for jumping, sliding, and swimming
4. **Walk to the gorge** — 10-30 minute hike to the river entry point

### During the Gorge Walk
You'll spend 2-4 hours working your way downstream through the gorge:

- **Walking and scrambling** — Picking your way over rocks and through shallow water
- **Swimming** — Crossing deeper pools (short swims, not marathon distances)
- **Natural slides** — Smooth rock chutes polished by millennia of water
- **Waterfall jumps** — Optional cliff jumps from 1-6 metres into deep pools
- **Waterfall climbing** — Scrambling up or alongside waterfalls
- **Exploring** — Caves, overhangs, and hidden sections

**Everything challenging is optional.** Good guides offer alternatives for nervous participants. Nobody should be forced to jump.

### After
- Walk back to the start (or get minibus transport)
- Change out of wet kit
- Enjoy that buzzing post-adventure feeling

## What You'll Need to Bring

### The Operator Provides
- Full wetsuit (5mm+)
- Wetsuit socks or neoprene booties
- Buoyancy aid
- Helmet
- Any ropes or safety equipment

### You Bring
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Swimsuit/shorts** | Worn under wetsuit |
| **Old trainers** | With decent grip — they will get destroyed |
| **Towel** | For changing afterwards |
| **Warm dry clothes** | You'll want them after |
| **Change of shoes** | Don't drive home in wet trainers |
| **Water & snacks** | Most sessions don't include food |

**Don't bring:** Jewellery (will get lost), expensive watches, phones (unless waterproof), jeans.

## Where to Go Gorge Walking in Wales

### Brecon Beacons — The Best
The **"Waterfall Country"** around Ystradfellte and Pontneddfechan has the highest concentration of gorges in Wales:

**Key Rivers:**
- **Afon Mellte** — Classic gorge with multiple waterfalls, the most popular
- **River Sychryd** — Dramatic and photogenic
- **Afon Nedd (Neath)** — Family-friendly sections available
- **Afon Pyrddin** — Wilder and less visited

This area is part of the famous **Four Waterfalls Walk** — gorge walking takes you into the waterfalls rather than past them.

### Snowdonia
Several operators run gorge walks in the rivers flowing off Snowdonia's mountains:

- **Ogwen Valley** gorges
- **Aber Falls** area
- Rivers near Betws-y-Coed

Generally smaller gorges than Brecon Beacons but still excellent.

First-timers should book a **Classic** session unless going with young children.

## Best Time of Year

Gorge walking runs **year-round** in Wales (it's wet anyway!), but conditions vary:

| Season | Water Level | Temperature | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Spring (Mar-May)** | High | Cold (8-12°C) | Powerful waterfalls, dramatic |
| **Summer (Jun-Aug)** | Variable | Warmest (12-16°C) | Best for beginners, warmest water |
| **Autumn (Sep-Nov)** | Rising | Cooling (10-14°C) | Beautiful colours, good flows |
| **Winter (Dec-Feb)** | High | Cold (6-10°C) | Dramatic but challenging |

**Sweet spot:** Late June to September — warm enough to be comfortable, water levels usually good.

**After heavy rain:** Water levels rise significantly. Operators may cancel or change routes for safety — this is a good thing.

## Safety

### Is It Safe?
Yes, with accredited operators. Look for:
- **AALA (Adventure Activities Licensing Authority)** certification
- **Qualified guides** with White Water Leader or Canyon Guide qualifications
- **First aid trained** staff
- **Daily risk assessments** and weather checks

### What Could Go Wrong?
Serious incidents are rare with professional operators. Minor risks include:
- Scrapes and bruises from rocks (wetsuit protects most of you)
- Cold (wetsuits and movement keep you warm)
- Slipping (guides teach safe movement techniques)

Operators adapt routes based on conditions — they won't take you into dangerous situations.

## Tips for First-Timers

### Before You Go
1. **Book ahead** — Popular dates sell out
2. **Check weather** — Sessions usually run in rain, but flooding cancels
3. **Eat beforehand** — You'll burn plenty of energy
4. **Don't drink alcohol** — Obvious, but worth saying

### During
1. **Listen to the guide** — They know the gorge intimately
2. **Ask questions** — No stupid questions about safety
3. **It's OK to skip jumps** — Nobody judges you
4. **Embrace the cold** — It gets easier after the first few minutes
5. **Keep moving** — Standing still = getting cold

### After
1. **Change quickly** — You'll cool down fast
2. **Hot drink** — Many centres have cafés
3. **Book your next one** — First-timers often get hooked

## What to Combine It With

Gorge walking is often part of a multi-activity day or weekend:

| Combination | Why It Works |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Gorge walking + Caving** | Stay wet, different environment |
| **Gorge walking + Coasteering** | Freshwater then saltwater |
| **Gorge walking + Climbing** | Mixed skills day |
| **Gorge walking + Four Waterfalls Walk** | See the falls from different angles |

Many operators offer **multi-activity packages** with better value than booking separately.

## The Smart Choice

**First-timer, nervous about water?** Book with an established operator like Adventures Wales or Gorge Walking Wales. Choose a "Classic" session, mention your concerns when booking, and they'll look after you.

**Family with kids 8+?** Look for family sessions or easy routes — operators will adapt the challenge level.

**Want maximum adrenaline?** Book an Adventure or Extreme session, or ask about the most challenging gorge available.

**Budget conscious?** Groups of 5+ get discounts. Midweek sessions sometimes cheaper than weekends.
