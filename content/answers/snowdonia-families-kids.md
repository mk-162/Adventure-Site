# Is Snowdonia good for families with children?

## Quick Answer

Absolutely! Snowdonia (Eryri) offers a ton of family-friendly adventures, from gentle hikes around Llyn Ogwen to thrilling zip lines at Zip World. Just be sure to choose activities appropriate for your kids' ages and abilities, and pack for all types of weather.

## Family-Friendly Activities in Snowdonia

Snowdonia isn't just for hardcore mountaineers; there are plenty of options for families with children of all ages. For younger kids, consider a walk around the picturesque Llyn Padarn in Llanberis, where you can also take a ride on the Llanberis Lake Railway. The railway offers stunning views of Snowdon and is a relaxing way to experience the scenery. Alternatively, head to Greenwood Family Park near Y Felinheli, offering a mix of eco-friendly rides, play areas, and live entertainment, with tickets costing around £20 per person.

For slightly older children, the Sygun Copper Mine near Beddgelert provides a fascinating underground adventure, costing approximately £12 for adults and £8 for children. If your family is up for a bit more of a challenge, try the Miners' Trail up Snowdon; it's longer but less steep than the Llanberis Path. For adrenaline junkies, Zip World has several locations in Snowdonia, including Zip World Fforest near Betws-y-Coed, which offers treetop adventures and zip lines suitable for children aged 5 and up, with prices starting from £35. Remember that Snowdonia can get very busy during peak season (July and August), so book activities in advance.
