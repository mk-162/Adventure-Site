# What are the best Coasteering tips for beginners?

## Quick Answer

For beginners, the best coasteering tip is to always go with a reputable operator like TYF Adventure in Pembrokeshire or Celtic Quest Coasteering in Anglesey. They provide the necessary safety gear and expert guidance. Start with a beginner-friendly route, listen carefully to the safety briefing, and never attempt jumps or scrambles beyond your comfort level.

## Choosing the Right Coasteering Operator and Location

When starting your coasteering journey, selecting the right operator and location is crucial. TYF Adventure, based in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, offers introductory coasteering sessions ideal for beginners, often exploring the stunning Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. Expect to pay around £50-£70 for a half-day session. Another excellent option is Celtic Quest Coasteering on Anglesey, known for its experienced guides and routes suitable for various skill levels. They often explore the coastline near Holyhead, offering breathtaking views and exhilarating swims.

Consider the time of year. Coasteering is most enjoyable during the warmer months (May-September) when the sea temperature is more forgiving. However, even in summer, the Welsh coast can be unpredictable, so a good wetsuit is essential. Many operators provide high-quality wetsuits as part of their package. Look for operators who prioritize safety and have experienced guides familiar with the local tides and conditions. Always check reviews and ensure they have proper insurance and certifications.

## Understanding Coasteering Levels and Locations

Different locations offer varying levels of difficulty for coasteering. Here's a comparison to help you choose:

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Pembrokeshire Coast National Park | Families, First-timers | Easy to Moderate | St Davids, Pembrokeshire |
| Anglesey Coastline | Adventurous beginners | Moderate | Holyhead, Anglesey |
| Gower Peninsula | Confident Swimmers | Moderate to Challenging | The Mumbles, Gower |

## Practical Tips

- Always wear appropriate footwear. Most operators provide specialized coasteering shoes, but if you're using your own, ensure they have good grip and ankle support. Old trainers are ideal.
- Check the tide times before you go. Coasteering is heavily influenced by the tides, and some routes are only accessible at certain times. Your operator will handle this, but it's good to be aware.
- Don't be afraid to ask questions. The guides are there to help you have a safe and enjoyable experience. If you're unsure about a jump or scramble, speak up.
- Book in advance, especially during peak season. Popular operators like TYF and Celtic Quest Coasteering can get fully booked weeks in advance.
