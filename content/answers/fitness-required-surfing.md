# How fit do I need to be for Surfing in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Surfing in Wales requires a reasonable level of fitness. You don't need to be an athlete, but you should be comfortable swimming in the sea and have the stamina to paddle against currents. Expect a full-body workout, especially in your arms and core!

## Understanding the Physical Demands of Surfing

Surfing isn't just about standing on a board; it's a physically demanding activity involving paddling, duck-diving (pushing through waves), popping up, and maintaining balance. The better your fitness, the longer you'll last in the water and the more you'll enjoy it. If you're a complete beginner, consider starting with a lesson at a surf school like Porthcawl Surf School on Rest Bay, Porthcawl, where they'll teach you the basics and get you used to the ocean. A two-hour group lesson typically costs around £35-£45. Bodyboarding is a less strenuous alternative, and lessons are often available from the same providers.

For intermediate to advanced surfers tackling bigger waves at spots like Llangennith on the Gower Peninsula, a higher level of fitness is essential. You'll need the strength and endurance to paddle out through strong currents and the agility to handle more challenging conditions. Cold water can also sap your energy quickly, so acclimatisation and appropriate wetsuit thickness are crucial, especially during the winter months.

## Practical Tips

- Before your trip, improve your paddling strength with swimming or kayaking. Even simple exercises like push-ups and planks can help build core stability.
- Check the surf report and tide times before heading out. Strong tides can create challenging currents, especially around headlands.
- Always surf within your abilities and never surf alone. Consider joining a local surf club for support and guidance.
- If you're new to surfing in Wales, start with a reputable surf school. They'll provide equipment, instruction, and local knowledge.
