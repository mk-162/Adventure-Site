  "introduction": "Anglesey's 125-mile coastline is an embarrassment of riches. While the south coast of Wales gets the headlines, this island off the northwest tip has beaches that rival anywhere in Britain — but with a fraction of the visitors.\n\nThe signature combination is sand + Snowdonia views. From multiple Anglesey beaches, you get golden sand in the foreground with the full Snowdonia mountain range as a backdrop across the Menai Strait. It's a combination that feels almost unfair.\n\nAnglesey also has something rare in North Wales: east-facing beaches. When the prevailing westerlies are battering the west coast, Anglesey's eastern bays can be calm, sunny, and sheltered. The island's position creates microclimates that give it more sunshine hours than most of North Wales.\n\nWater quality is consistently excellent. Many beaches hold Blue Flag or Green Coast awards. The Anglesey Coastal Path circles the entire island and connects them all.",
  "rankingCriteria": "Rankings combine scenic quality (including Snowdonia views), sand quality, water clarity, crowd levels, and character. We favour beaches that offer something you can't get on the mainland — because that's Anglesey's superpower.",
