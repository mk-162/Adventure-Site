# Horse Riding & Pony Trekking in Wales

Wales and horses go way back. The Welsh Mountain Pony has roamed these hills for centuries, and the country's network of bridleways — over 600 miles in the Brecon Beacons alone — makes it one of the best places in Britain to ride.

Whether you're a complete beginner wanting a gentle hour on a sure-footed cob, or an experienced rider looking for a multi-day trans-Wales adventure, there's something here for you.

## What to Expect

Most Welsh riding centres offer a range of experiences:

- **Pony rides** (20–30 mins) — Perfect for young children, usually led by staff. From around £10–15.
- **Hour rides** — The sweet spot for beginners and families. Typically around £25–35. You'll get basic instruction and a guided ride around the farm on bridleways.
- **Half-day treks** (2–3 hours) — More adventurous routes into the hills. £35–50. Some riding experience helpful but not always required.
- **Full-day rides** (5–6 hours) — Serious mountain trekking with packed lunch stops and panoramic views. £55–70. Usually requires some experience.
- **Multi-day riding holidays** — Trans Wales Trails and similar operators offer 2–5 day adventures with accommodation included. The ultimate Welsh riding experience.

## Where to Ride

### Brecon Beacons (Best for Variety)
The heartland of Welsh riding. The Brecon Beacons has more bridleways per square mile than almost anywhere in the UK. Cantref Riding Centre is the only centre licensed to trek on the Beacons themselves — their Welsh Pony Trail Ride follows the paths of wild mountain ponies. Grange Trekking near Abergavenny specialises in Black Mountain rides on sturdy Welsh cobs. Tregoyd Mountain Riders offers riding holidays in the Black Mountains.

### Mid Wales (Best for Solitude)
Quieter trails, bigger skies. Trans Wales Trails operates from a traditional Welsh longhouse, offering fully inclusive weekend breaks with two full days' riding.

### Snowdonia (Best for Scenery)
Mountain riding with dramatic backdrops. Several centres offer rides through Snowdonia's lower valleys and foothills.

### Pembrokeshire (Best for Coast)
Beach rides and cliff-top trails. Some centres combine coast and countryside in a single ride.

## Practical Tips

- **What to wear**: Long trousers (jeans are fine), boots or wellies with a small heel, layers on top. Riding hats are provided by all centres.
- **Weight limits**: Most centres have a rider weight limit of around 14–16 stone (89–102 kg). Always check when booking.
- **Minimum age**: Varies. Pony rides from age 3–4, longer rides typically from age 6–8.
- **Booking**: Essential in school holidays and weekends. Midweek rides are easier to get.
- **Weather**: Rides go ahead in light rain — you're in Wales, after all. Heavy rain or high winds may cause cancellations.

## Best Time to Visit

- **Spring (April–May)**: Wildflowers on the trails, lambs in the fields, pleasant temperatures. Can still be muddy.
- **Summer (June–August)**: Longest daylight, warmest weather, busiest period. Book well ahead.
- **Autumn (September–October)**: Stunning colours, quieter trails, crisp riding weather. Perhaps the best time.
- **Winter (November–March)**: Many centres operate year-round but with reduced hours. Shorter rides only. Exhilarating on a clear day.

## Who It's For

Horse riding in Wales suits almost everyone. The Welsh cob is famously gentle and sure-footed — ideal for nervous beginners. But the terrain and the variety of rides mean experienced riders won't be bored either. It's particularly popular with families (kids love the Own a Pony days at Cantref) and couples looking for something different.
