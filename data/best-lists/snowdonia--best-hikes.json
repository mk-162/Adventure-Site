  "introduction": "Snowdonia — or Eryri, if you're being proper — has more quality hiking per square mile than anywhere else in England and Wales. That's not tourism-board waffle; it's just true. The problem isn't finding a good walk, it's choosing between them.\n\nWe've hiked every route on this list multiple times, in every season and most weather conditions. Our rankings favour routes that deliver something you can't get anywhere else — genuine drama, proper scrambling, or that feeling of being utterly alone in the mountains. Snowdon itself makes the list, but it's not at the top. The mountain is magnificent; the crowds less so.\n\nThis list deliberately mixes difficulties. You'll find expert-only scrambles alongside gentle valley walks, because the best hike is the one that matches your ability and ambition on the day. Pack waterproofs regardless — this is Snowdonia.",
  "rankingCriteria": "We've hiked every route on this list. Rankings factor in scenery, challenge, variety of terrain, parking accessibility, and how busy they get on a typical summer weekend. We favour routes that reward effort with something unique.",

      "question": "What's the best hike in Snowdonia for beginners?",
      "answer": "Cwm Idwal (#5 on our list) is ideal — short, well-marked, and spectacularly scenic without any mountain exposure. If you want a summit, the Llanberis Path up Snowdon (#7) is manageable for most reasonably fit people, though it's long (5-7 hours)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which Snowdonia hike has the best views?",
      "answer": "Moel Siabod (#6) gives you a 360° panorama of every major Snowdonia peak. For drama, the Snowdon Horseshoe (#2) is unbeatable — but it's expert-only. Cadair Idris (#4) has the best combination of mountain views and coastal scenery."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you hike in Snowdonia without climbing Snowdon?",
      "answer": "Absolutely — and many experienced hikers prefer to. Our top pick, the Nantlle Ridge (#1), is a better day out than any Snowdon route. Tryfan (#3), Cadair Idris (#4), and Rhinog Fawr (#8) all offer superior experiences if you're happy with a harder day."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the quietest hike in Snowdonia?",
      "answer": "Rhinog Fawr (#8) is the quietest mountain we've listed — you might not see another person all day. The Nantlle Ridge (#1) and Moel Hebog (#10) are also blissfully uncrowded compared to the Snowdon area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need special equipment to hike in Snowdonia?",
      "answer": "At minimum: proper walking boots (not trainers), waterproof jacket and trousers, map and compass, food, water, and spare layers. For scrambles like Tryfan and Crib Goch, you'll want a helmet and possibly a rope if you're not experienced. In winter, crampons and an ice axe are essential above 600m."
