# Horse Riding Safety in Wales

Horse riding is one of the safest adventure activities in Wales — the Welsh cob is famously calm and sure-footed, and reputable centres match horses to riders carefully. But horses are large, powerful animals and the terrain can be challenging. A bit of preparation goes a long way.

## Before You Book

### Weight Limits
Most Welsh riding centres have a rider weight limit of **14–16 stone (89–102 kg)**. Some can accommodate heavier riders on their larger horses — always ask when booking. This isn't about judging anyone; it's about the welfare of the horse. Centres that don't enforce weight limits aren't ones you want to ride with.

### Experience Levels
Be honest about your ability. Centres match horses to riders based on what you tell them, and getting it wrong isn't fun for you or the horse.

- **Complete beginner**: Short rides (1 hour) on steady horses with close supervision. The Welsh cob is ideal — patient, calm, happy to follow the horse in front.
- **Novice** (a few rides, basic confidence): Half-day treks on gentle terrain. You should be comfortable at walk and able to steer.
- **Intermediate** (regular rider, confident at trot and canter): Full-day rides and multi-day breaks. More varied terrain, faster pace when appropriate.
- **Advanced**: Experienced riders can access longer, more challenging routes including mountain terrain. Some centres offer unaccompanied rides for advanced riders on known trails.

### Minimum Ages
- Pony rides (led): Usually from age 3–4
- Short rides: From age 6–8 at most centres
- Longer treks: Usually 10+ or 12+
- Multi-day rides: Typically 14+ or 16+

Under-18s always need parental consent.

## What to Wear

Getting this right makes a real difference to your comfort and safety.

### Essential
- **Hard hat**: All centres provide these to current safety standards. You can bring your own if it meets BS/EN standards, but don't worry if you don't have one.
- **Long trousers**: Jeans are fine for short rides. Jodhpurs or riding tights are much more comfortable for anything over an hour — jeans chafe on the inner thigh.
- **Boots with a small heel**: This is genuinely important. The heel stops your foot sliding through the stirrup. Ankle boots or short wellies work well. Walking boots with a defined heel are fine. **Trainers are a no-go** — your foot can slip through the stirrup and get trapped, which is how serious injuries happen.
- **Layers on top**: Mountain temperatures can be 5–10°C colder than the car park. A base layer, fleece and waterproof is the standard combo.

### Helpful but Not Essential
- **Gloves**: Stops reins rubbing on long rides. Any gloves work.
- **Backpack**: Small one for water, snacks, phone on longer rides. Make sure it sits high and won't bounce.
- **Sunscreen and hat peak**: Riding hats don't shade your face.

### What NOT to Wear
- Trainers or slip-on shoes (foot gets trapped in stirrup)
- Loose scarves (can catch on branches)
- Dangly jewellery (same reason)
- Shorts (saddle rub is real and it's miserable)

## On the Ride

### Mounting and Dismounting
Staff will help you mount and adjust your stirrups. Always mount from the left side. When dismounting, take both feet out of the stirrups first.

### Basic Riding Safety
- **Keep your heels down** — this is the most important thing your instructor will tell you. It keeps your feet secure in the stirrups.
- **Hold the reins correctly** — your instructor will show you. Never wrap reins around your hands.
- **Maintain spacing** — keep at least one horse length between you and the horse in front. Horses can kick if another horse gets too close.
- **Don't shout or make sudden movements** — horses are prey animals and spook at unexpected things. Stay calm, speak softly.
- **If your horse bolts** — sit deep, don't lean forward, and pull the rein to one side to turn the horse in a circle. But honestly, this almost never happens on guided rides with well-trained trekking horses.

### Falling Off
It happens, though rarely on guided treks. If you feel yourself going:
- **Let go of the reins** — don't try to hold on, you'll pull the horse over
- **Tuck and roll** — curl up, protect your head, roll away from the horse's feet
- **Stay still for a moment** — check yourself before jumping up

The hard hat is your best friend here. This is why centres insist on them.

## Welsh Terrain Considerations

- **Mountain weather changes fast**: A sunny morning can turn to wind and rain by lunchtime, especially in the Brecon Beacons and Snowdonia. Dress for conditions to deteriorate.
- **Mud**: Welsh bridleways can be extremely muddy, especially autumn through spring. Horses are fine with this — they're bred for it. You might not be. Expect to get splashed.
- **Steep ground**: Mountain treks involve real ascents and descents. Lean forward going uphill, lean back going downhill. Your horse knows the path — trust it.
- **Gates and stiles**: You may need to open and close gates from horseback. Your guide will usually handle this.
- **Livestock**: You'll share trails with sheep, and occasionally cattle. Horses are used to this but stay alert if livestock are close.

## Medical Considerations

- **Back problems**: Riding involves impact through the spine, especially at trot. If you have back issues, discuss with the centre before booking.
- **Allergies**: Horse hair is a common allergen. If you're allergic to horses, this probably isn't your activity. Antihistamines help with mild allergies.
- **Pregnancy**: Most centres won't take pregnant riders, especially after the first trimester. Always disclose this.

## Emergency Information

All reputable centres carry first aid kits and have emergency procedures. Mobile phone signal can be patchy in mountain areas — centres will have communication plans for their routes.

If someone is injured on a ride:
1. Stay calm, stay on your horse unless instructed otherwise
2. Follow the guide's instructions
3. Mountain Rescue can be called on 999 if needed — give the grid reference or what3words location

## Choosing a Centre

Look for:
- **BHS (British Horse Society) approved** or **ABRS (Association of British Riding Schools)** accredited centres
- Current insurance and proper safety equipment
- Good reviews mentioning horse welfare and safety briefings
- Weight limit enforcement (a sign of a responsible centre)
- Willingness to match your experience level honestly rather than just selling the longest ride
