# How Many Days Do You Need in Snowdonia?

## Quick Answer

Minimum three days for the highlights. Five days to properly explore. A week if you want to combine mountains, coast, activities, and actually relax. Snowdonia is bigger and more varied than most people expect — don't try to cram everything into a long weekend.

## The Detail

### Three Days (The Highlights)

Three days gives you a solid taster:
*   **Day 1:** Hike Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa). The Llanberis Path is the most popular (and gentler), but the Pyg Track is shorter with better views. Allow 5-7 hours round trip. [Find hiking in Snowdonia](/snowdonia/things-to-do/hiking).
*   **Day 2:** Do something adrenaline-fuelled. Velocity 2 at Zip World in Bethesda (fastest zip line in Europe), Bounce Below in Blaenau Ffestiniog (underground trampolines), or [gorge walking](/snowdonia/things-to-do/gorge-walking) if you fancy getting wet.
*   **Day 3:** Explore at a gentler pace. Wander Betws-y-Coed, walk to Swallow Falls, or take the Ffestiniog Railway from Porthmadog through stunning scenery.

### Five Days (The Full Experience)

With five days you can really get to know the place:
*   Add [mountain biking at Coed y Brenin](/snowdonia/things-to-do/mountain-biking) — trails from beginner to expert through ancient forest.
*   Walk Cadair Idris via the Minffordd Path — arguably a better mountain walk than Snowdon and far quieter.
*   Spend a day on the coast. The Llŷn Peninsula is 30 minutes from Snowdonia's heart and has gorgeous beaches. [Kayaking around Bardsey Sound](/llyn-peninsula/things-to-do/kayaking) on a calm day is unforgettable.
*   Visit Caernarfon Castle or Harlech Castle — both UNESCO World Heritage Sites and genuinely impressive.

### A Week or More

A week lets you combine the big stuff with hidden gems:
*   The Carneddau range — wild, empty mountains with wild ponies and almost no other walkers.
*   Rock climbing at Idwal Slabs or the Llanberis Pass. [Find climbing in Snowdonia](/snowdonia/things-to-do/climbing).
*   [Wild swimming in Llyn Padarn or Llyn Idwal](/snowdonia/things-to-do/wild-swimming) (bring a wetsuit — these are mountain lakes).
*   Portmeirion — the bizarre, beautiful Italianate village on the coast. Worth a half day.
*   Buffer days for weather. Snowdonia's weather is famously unpredictable. Having spare days means a rained-out Monday becomes Bounce Below or the National Slate Museum, and you catch Snowdon on Wednesday when it clears.

## Practical Tips

*   **Roads are slow.** Snowdonia's roads are mostly single-track and winding. A 20-mile journey can take an hour. Don't try to base yourself somewhere and dash across the park daily — stay somewhere central like Betws-y-Coed, Beddgelert, or Llanberis.
*   **Parking matters.** Pen y Pass (for Snowdon) fills by 8am in summer. Book ahead or take the Sherpa bus from Llanberis.
*   **Book activities early** in peak season. Zip World, guided walks, and [coasteering sessions](/anglesey/things-to-do/coasteering) on nearby Anglesey fill up days in advance.
*   **Weather flexibility is everything.** Have a mix of outdoor and indoor plans each day so rain doesn't ruin your trip.

## The Smart Choice

If you're deciding between a rushed three-day trip and a more relaxed five-day visit, go for five every time. Snowdonia rewards a slower pace — the best moments are often the unplanned ones. A quiet lake discovered on a detour, a pub found at the end of a valley road, or a mountain view that appears when the cloud finally lifts. Give yourself time to find them.
