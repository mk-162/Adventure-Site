# When should I avoid visiting Carmarthenshire?

## Quick Answer

Avoid Carmarthenshire during peak school holidays (late July/August, Christmas, Easter) if you dislike crowds, as popular spots like Pendine Sands and Laugharne can get very busy. Weekends, particularly bank holiday weekends, also see an influx of visitors. If you're planning outdoor activities, be mindful of shorter daylight hours and potentially harsh weather conditions during the winter months (November-February).

## Dodging the Crowds

Carmarthenshire, while beautiful, experiences peak tourism during school holidays and bank holiday weekends. During these times, expect higher prices for accommodation and activities, as well as crowded beaches, trails, and attractions. For example, parking at Pendine Sands (£5-£8 per day during peak season) can fill up quickly, and you might find yourself queuing for a spot. Laugharne, famous for its Dylan Thomas connections, becomes particularly congested. If you prefer a quieter experience, consider visiting during the shoulder seasons (April-June or September-October). You'll still enjoy pleasant weather, but with fewer people around.

If you're set on visiting during the summer, try exploring some of the less well-known spots. Instead of Pendine, head to Marros Sands for a more secluded beach experience. Or, trade the popular Brecon Beacons trails for a hike in the quieter Preseli Hills.

## Weather Woes and Winter Considerations

Carmarthenshire's coastal location means it can experience unpredictable weather, especially during the winter. November to February brings shorter days, colder temperatures, and a higher chance of rain and strong winds. While this can create dramatic coastal scenery, it's not ideal for activities like kayaking or cycling. Some outdoor activity providers, like Llandovery-based Cambrian Safaris, may operate a reduced schedule or offer different types of tours during the winter months.

Consider the impact on specific activities:

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Coastal Walking | Calm days with sunshine | Easy to Moderate | Wales Coastal Path (various sections) |
| Mountain Biking | Dry trails, good visibility | Moderate to Strenuous | Brechfa Forest |
| Watersports (Kayaking/Paddleboarding) | Warm weather, calm seas | Easy to Moderate | Llansteffan or Pendine |

## Practical Tips

- Book accommodation and activities well in advance, especially if travelling during peak season.
- Check the weather forecast before heading out and be prepared for changing conditions.
- Consider visiting during the week to avoid weekend crowds.
- Pack appropriate clothing and footwear for the activities you have planned.
