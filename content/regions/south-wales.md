# About South Wales

South Wales is a land where ancient history meets raw, untamed landscapes. From the rugged coastline of the Vale of Glamorgan to the soaring peaks of Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons National Park), adventure awaits around every bend. Here, you can find yourself scrambling up a waterfall one day and exploring a medieval castle the next.

This region offers a unique blend of adrenaline-pumping activities and cultural immersion. The vibrant cities of Cardiff and Swansea provide a buzzing backdrop to the wilder pursuits on offer, meaning you’re never far from a warm pub or a hearty meal after a day of conquering mountains or riding the waves. South Wales is where adventure meets heritage.

## Best For

- Hiking and Mountaineering: Bannau Brycheiniog offers challenging trails and stunning views.
- Watersports: Coasteering, surfing, and kayaking along the dramatic coastline.
- Urban Adventure: Unique experiences like Zip World's city-based adventures.

## Best Time to Visit

The best time to visit South Wales for outdoor adventures is between May and September. During these months, you'll experience milder weather, longer daylight hours, and the most favorable conditions for hiking, climbing, and watersports. July and August are the warmest months but also the busiest, so consider visiting in the shoulder seasons (May-June or September) to avoid crowds.

While winter can be beautiful with snow-capped mountains, many higher-altitude activities may be limited due to weather conditions. Some smaller adventure operators may also have reduced hours or seasonal closures during the off-season. Always check ahead!

## Getting There

Cardiff Airport (CWL) is the main international airport serving South Wales. It offers connections to major UK and European cities. Alternatively, Bristol Airport (BRS) is a viable option, located just across the border in England, with easy onward travel by train or car.

Cardiff Central is the primary train station, with frequent services to London Paddington (approx. 2 hours), Birmingham, and other major UK cities. Driving to South Wales is straightforward via the M4 motorway. Driving times from London are roughly 3 hours, and from Birmingham, around 2.5 hours.

## Pro Tips

- Pack for all weather: South Wales is known for its changeable conditions, even in summer. Layers are key.
- Check local tide times: Essential for planning any coastal activities, especially coasteering or surfing.
- Explore the Valleys: Venture beyond the national park to discover hidden gems and quieter trails in the South Wales Valleys.
