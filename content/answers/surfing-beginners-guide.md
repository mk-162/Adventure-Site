# What are the best Surfing tips for beginners?

## Quick Answer

Start with a surf lesson at a reputable surf school like Porthcawl Surf School on Rest Bay. Focus on mastering the pop-up technique on land before hitting the waves, and always be mindful of the tides and weather conditions. Remember, learning to surf takes time and patience, so don't get discouraged if you don't catch every wave.

## Choosing the Right Surf School and Beach

Wales boasts some fantastic beaches for learning to surf, but picking the right one and a good instructor is key. Porthcawl Surf School, located right on Rest Bay, offers beginner lessons from around £35 for a group session. Rest Bay is ideal because it's sheltered and has a consistent swell, perfect for those first wobbly stands. Another great option is Llangennith on the Gower Peninsula; however, this beach is more exposed, so check the surf report before you go.

TYF Adventure in St Davids also offers surf lessons, often incorporating coasteering for a full day of ocean adventure. Expect to pay around £60-£80 for a combined surf and coasteering experience. When booking, ask about instructor-to-student ratios – smaller groups mean more personalized attention. Always ensure the school is accredited by a recognized body like Surfing GB.

## Understanding the Conditions

Understanding the ocean conditions is crucial for a safe and enjoyable surf. Pay close attention to the tide times; low tide often reveals sandbanks that create gentler waves, ideal for beginners. Websites like Magicseaweed provide detailed surf forecasts, including wave height, swell direction, and wind conditions. A light onshore wind is generally good, creating clean, breaking waves. However, strong offshore winds can make the waves dumpy and difficult to manage.

| Condition | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Low Tide | Beginners | Easier | Rest Bay, Porthcawl |
| Small Swell (1-2ft) | Beginners | Easier | Llangennith, Gower |
| Onshore Wind | Beginners | Easier | Freshwater West, Pembrokeshire (with caution) |
| Sheltered Bay | Beginners | Easier | Rest Bay, Porthcawl |

## Practical Tips

- Practice your pop-up on dry land repeatedly until it becomes second nature. This will give you a huge advantage when you're in the water.
- When paddling out, stay to the side of the breaking waves to conserve energy. Don't try to paddle straight through them.
- Rest Bay car park can get very busy, especially during peak season (July-August). Arrive early or consider using public transport. Parking charges apply.
- Always wear a leash! It keeps your board close to you and prevents it from becoming a hazard to others. Also, be aware of rip currents and what to do if you get caught in one (paddle parallel to the shore).
