# What should I expect on your first Zip Lining experience?

## Quick Answer

Expect a rush of adrenaline and stunning views! Your first zip lining experience will likely involve a safety briefing, harness fitting, and then soaring through the air on steel cables. Operators like Zip World provide all the necessary equipment and training, so you can focus on enjoying the ride.

## Gearing Up for Your Aerial Adventure

Your zip lining adventure begins with a thorough safety briefing from trained professionals. Operators such as Zip World, with locations like Penrhyn Quarry and Llechwedd Slate Caverns, will equip you with a harness, helmet, and any other necessary safety gear. They'll explain how to use the equipment and what to expect during the zip line ride. Don't be afraid to ask questions – they're there to ensure you feel comfortable and confident. The initial briefing can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the complexity of the course. Some courses, like those at Go Ape! in Margam Park, may require a short practice run closer to the ground before you ascend to the higher platforms.

Once you're geared up, you'll make your way to the first platform. This often involves a short hike, sometimes uphill, so wear appropriate footwear. The guides will connect your harness to the zip line cable, double-checking everything for safety. Then, it's time to take the leap! Expect a brief moment of hesitation followed by an exhilarating rush as you accelerate down the line. The views, especially at locations like Zip World Velocity 2, overlooking Penrhyn Quarry, are simply breathtaking. Prices for zip lining experiences generally range from £50 to £150 depending on the location and length of the course.

## Practical Tips

- Book in advance, especially during peak season (summer and school holidays), as zip lining experiences are very popular.
- Wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes. No sandals or flip-flops allowed!
- On a sunny day, wear sunscreen and bring sunglasses. Even on cloudy days, the wind at the top of the zip line can be surprisingly strong.
- Arrive at least 30 minutes before your scheduled time to allow for check-in and gearing up. Parking at Zip World locations can be busy, so factor that into your travel time.
- Listen carefully to the safety briefing and follow the instructions of the guides at all times. They are the experts!
