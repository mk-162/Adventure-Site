# What to Do in Wales When It Rains?

Go anyway. Seriously. Half the best adventures in Wales are actually better in the rain — gorge walking, caving, coasteering, and wild swimming don't care about the weather because you're already wet.

## Adventures That Thrive in Rain

### Gorge Walking

You're wading through rivers and climbing waterfalls. Rain means higher water levels, which means bigger plunge pools and more dramatic rapids. [Gorge walking](/activities/gorge-walking) in the [Brecon Beacons](/brecon-beacons) or [Snowdonia](/snowdonia) is genuinely more exciting after rainfall. Operators run sessions in all but the most extreme conditions. £45–£65 per person.

### Caving

Underground, it doesn't rain. Wales has some of Britain's best caving systems — the Brecon Beacons alone contain the three longest cave systems in the UK. You'll be in a wetsuit crawling through passages that are millions of years old. Weather above ground is completely irrelevant. [Caving sessions](/activities/caving) from around £45–£60 per person.

### Coasteering

You're jumping off cliffs into the sea. A bit of rain on your face won't register. [Coasteering](/activities/coasteering) in [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire) runs through most weather conditions — it's wind and swell that affect sessions, not rain. From £50–£70 per person.

### Zip Lining

Zip World's sites in [North Wales](/north-wales) operate in rain (they'd never open otherwise). Velocity 2 at Penrhyn Quarry and Titan at Llechwedd all run in wet weather. If anything, flying through rain and mist adds atmosphere. From £50–£85 per person.

## Indoor Adventures for Proper Downpours

When even the Welsh outdoors is too much:

**Bounce Below, Blaenau Ffestiniog** — Underground trampolines in a massive slate cavern. It's bonkers and brilliant, and completely sheltered from anything the sky throws at you. Around £25–£30 per person.

**Surf Snowdonia (Adventure Parc Snowdonia)** — Inland surf lagoon at Dolgarrog. Consistent waves regardless of weather, with beginner and intermediate sessions available. From £40 per person.

**Go Below, Snowdonia** — Underground adventure in abandoned mines. Zip lines, abseiling, and scrambling through tunnels — all underground. A proper rainy-day adventure that rivals anything above ground. From £55 per person.

**Indoor Climbing** — Climbing walls at Beacon Climbing Centre (Caernarfon), Boulders (Cardiff), and several other centres across Wales. Drop-in sessions from £8–£12.

## The Welsh Attitude to Rain

Here's the thing about Wales: it rains roughly 150–200 days a year depending on where you are. If you wait for sunshine, you'll never do anything. The locals have a saying — "there's no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing." They're right. Invest in a decent waterproof jacket and just crack on.

The landscape is green for a reason. And honestly, misty mountains with low cloud hanging in the valleys? That's Wales at its most atmospheric.
