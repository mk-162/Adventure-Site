# How many days should I spend in North Wales?

## Quick Answer

To truly experience North Wales, aim for at least 5 days. This allows you to explore Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park, tackle a mountain like Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), discover the coastline, and delve into the region's rich history. A week or longer will let you explore at a more relaxed pace and venture further afield.

## Crafting Your North Wales Itinerary

North Wales packs a serious punch when it comes to adventure. If you're into hiking, dedicate at least two days to Eryri. Day one could be conquering Yr Wyddfa via the Llanberis Path (allow 5-6 hours, £15 parking at the base during peak season). Day two could be spent exploring the Glyderau range, known for its challenging scrambles and dramatic rock formations (think Tryfan – only for experienced hikers!). For adrenaline junkies, a day at Zip World is a must. The Penrhyn Quarry location near Bethesda features Velocity 2, the fastest zip line in the world (£89+ per person).

Beyond the mountains, the coastline offers plenty. Spend a day exploring the Llyn Peninsula, with its secluded beaches like Porth Iago and charming villages like Aberdaron. Consider a coasteering adventure with TYF Adventure in Anglesey (£65 per person), exploring hidden coves and sea caves. History buffs should allocate a day to explore the castles of Conwy and Caernarfon (entry £12-£15 per castle), both UNESCO World Heritage sites. Remember that during peak season (July-August), booking accommodations and activities in advance is essential.

## Practical Tips

- Pack for all weather conditions, even in summer. The mountains can be unpredictable, and rain is always a possibility. A waterproof jacket and sturdy hiking boots are essential.
- Learn a few basic Welsh phrases. Locals appreciate the effort, and it can enhance your experience. "Bore da" (Good morning) and "diolch" (thank you) go a long way.
- Parking in popular spots like Yr Wyddfa and Betws-y-Coed can be a nightmare, especially during peak season. Arrive early or use the park-and-ride services. The Snowdon Sherpa bus is a great option for accessing various trailheads around Yr Wyddfa.
- Be aware that some trails in Eryri are not suitable for beginners. Check the difficulty rating and read recent reviews before setting off. Mountain Rescue callouts are common, so don't overestimate your abilities.
