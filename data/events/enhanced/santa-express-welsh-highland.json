  "description": "The Ffestiniog & Welsh Highland Railways' Santa Express offers one of the most magical Christmas experiences in North Wales. Steam through the spectacular Snowdonia landscape aboard historic narrow-gauge trains, with Father Christmas himself greeting young visitors in his grotto aboard the train. Each child receives a special gift from Santa, while families enjoy mince pies, festive refreshments, and carol singing as the steam engine winds through mountains and valleys. The journey departs from the charming Harbour Station in Porthmadog, offering breathtaking views of the Snowdonia mountains dressed in winter splendour. With some of the most comfortable carriages on any heritage railway, this is a truly memorable Christmas adventure that brings together Victorian railway magic and festive cheer.",
