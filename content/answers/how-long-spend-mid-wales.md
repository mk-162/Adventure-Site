# How many days should I spend in Mid Wales?

## Quick Answer

To truly experience Mid Wales, aim for a minimum of 3-4 days. This allows you to explore the diverse landscapes, from the Cambrian Mountains to the coast, and enjoy some of the region's best adventure activities. For a more immersive experience including hiking, biking, and watersports, a week-long stay is ideal.

## Exploring the Cambrian Mountains and Beyond

Mid Wales offers a diverse range of activities, and the time you need depends on your interests. If you're keen on hiking in the Cambrian Mountains (Welsh: *Mynyddoedd Cambria*), allocate at least two days. A great option is the Glyndŵr's Way National Trail, a 135-mile (217 km) route that cuts through the heart of Mid Wales. You could tackle a section of it over a couple of days, staying in charming towns like Machynlleth or Llanidloes. For mountain biking enthusiasts, the Nant yr Arian Forest near Aberystwyth offers world-class trails. A day pass costs around £10, and bike hire is available from Beics Brenin from around £35 per day.

For coastal adventures, head to Cardigan Bay. A boat trip from New Quay to spot dolphins will take around 2-3 hours and costs approximately £20-£30 per person. If watersports are your thing, Aberdovey offers excellent sailing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing opportunities. Lessons and equipment hire are readily available, with a half-day kitesurfing lesson costing around £60-£80. Consider visiting in the shoulder seasons (spring or autumn) to avoid the summer crowds and enjoy milder weather for hiking.
