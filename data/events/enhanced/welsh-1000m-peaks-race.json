  "description": "The Welsh 1000m Peaks Race is one of Britain's most demanding fell races—a traverse of all 15 peaks over 3,000ft in Wales, completed in a single continuous effort. From Aber Falls to Nant Peris, runners navigate 22 miles and 10,000ft of ascent across the Carneddau, Glyderau, and Snowdon massifs. This is serious mountain running: expect scrambling on Tryfan, exposed ridges, and navigation challenges in any conditions. The roll call of summits reads like a who's who of Welsh mountains, culminating in Wales' highest peak, Yr Wyddfa. Few races offer such a complete test of mountain running ability. Finish this, and you've truly conquered Wales.",
