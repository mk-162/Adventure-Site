# Where are the best Gorge Walking locations in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Wales is a gorge walking paradise! For beginners, the Afon Sychryd near Pontneddfechan in the Brecon Beacons is ideal, with its easily accessible waterfalls. More experienced gorge walkers should head to Eryri (Snowdonia) and explore the stunning, but challenging, gorges around Betws-y-Coed.

## Brecon Beacons: Waterfall Country

The Brecon Beacons National Park, often called "Waterfall Country," boasts numerous fantastic gorge walking spots, suitable for various skill levels. The Afon Sychryd, near the village of Pontneddfechan, is a popular choice for families and beginners. You can easily access the river and enjoy scrambling through the shallow pools and small waterfalls. For a more challenging experience, explore the gorges around Ystradfellte. Several operators, like Adventure Britain, offer guided gorge walking experiences in this area, typically costing between £50-£75 per person for a half-day session. Keep in mind that the water levels can rise quickly after heavy rain, so always check the weather forecast before you go. The best time to visit is during the warmer months (May-September) when the water is less frigid.

## Eryri (Snowdonia): Rugged Adventures

Eryri offers some of the most dramatic gorge walking in Wales, but it's generally best suited for experienced adventurers. The gorges around Betws-y-Coed, such as those found near the Fairy Glen, provide exhilarating scrambles and waterfall climbs. Be aware that some areas require permits or are privately owned, so it's crucial to do your research beforehand. Companies like TYF Adventure, based in St. Davids (although they operate across Wales), offer advanced gorge walking trips in Eryri, emphasizing safety and responsible exploration. Prices can range from £80-£120 per person, depending on the duration and complexity of the route. The season here is shorter, typically running from June to early September, due to colder water temperatures and potential for flash floods.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Afon Sychryd | Families & Beginners | Easy | Pontneddfechan, Brecon Beacons |
| Ystradfellte Gorges | Intermediate Scramblers | Moderate | Ystradfellte, Brecon Beacons |
| Fairy Glen Gorges | Experienced Adventurers | Challenging | Betws-y-Coed, Eryri |

## Practical Tips

- Always wear appropriate footwear. Old trainers with good grip are better than walking boots, as they allow you to feel the rock.
- Check the Natural Resources Wales website for water level warnings before heading out. River conditions can change rapidly.
- Consider booking with a local operator, especially if you're new to gorge walking. They know the safest routes and provide essential safety equipment like helmets and buoyancy aids.
- Parking in popular gorge walking areas like Pontneddfechan can be limited, especially during peak season. Arrive early to secure a spot.
