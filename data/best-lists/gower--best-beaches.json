  "introduction": "The Gower was the first place in Britain to be designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and its beaches are a big reason why. Within 20 miles of Swansea, you've got sweeping surf beaches, hidden coves, dramatic cliff-backed bays, and sand so clean it squeaks underfoot.\n\nWhat makes the Gower special is accessibility. Unlike Pembrokeshire (2+ hours from most cities), the Gower is 15 minutes from Swansea and under 3 hours from London, Birmingham, and Bristol. That means the famous beaches get busy in summer — but there are enough quiet alternatives that you can always find space.\n\nThis list covers the full range, from the Instagram-famous (Three Cliffs Bay, Rhossili) to genuinely secret spots that most visitors drive straight past. Water quality is excellent across the peninsula.",
  "rankingCriteria": "Rankings combine scenic beauty, sand quality, water clarity, facilities, crowd levels, and character. We favour beaches with something special — a view, a feature, or a feeling — rather than just 'nice sand and parking.'",

      "question": "What's the best beach on the Gower?",
      "answer": "Three Cliffs Bay (#1) for sheer beauty, Rhossili Bay (#2) for scale and drama, Oxwich Bay (#3) for family-friendly swimming. It depends what you want — there's no wrong answer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which Gower beaches are best for families?",
      "answer": "Oxwich Bay (#3) for calm swimming and easy parking. Port Eynon (#7) for a village setting with facilities. Caswell Bay (#5) for quick access from Swansea. All have gentle waves and sandy beaches."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Gower beaches dog-friendly?",
      "answer": "Most beaches allow dogs from October to April. Summer dog bans (May-September) apply on popular beaches during peak hours. Mewslade Bay (#4), Broughton Bay (#10), and Tor Bay (#9) allow dogs year-round. Check specific beaches before visiting."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get to Three Cliffs Bay?",
      "answer": "There's no road access. Walk from Southgate car park (15-20 minutes along the coast path) for the clifftop view, or from Pennard (through the valley, easier with children). You'll need to cross stepping stones over Pennard Pill — wear shoes you don't mind getting wet."
