# What should I expect on your first Caving experience?

## Quick Answer

Expect to get muddy, have an amazing time exploring the underworld, and be challenged both physically and mentally. Operators like Go Below Underground Adventures in Conwy offer guided trips for all levels, starting from around £69 per person. Be prepared to crawl, climb, and maybe even get a little wet!

## What to Expect Underground

Caving in Wales is a proper adventure, and conditions can vary wildly depending on the cave system and the time of year. With Go Below, based in Betws-y-Coed, you might find yourself traversing across deep chasms, wading through underground rivers, and squeezing through tight passages. Many caves, especially in the Brecon Beacons, are naturally cold and damp, so thermal layers are essential.

For a less strenuous introduction, consider a trip to Dan yr Ogof, the National Showcaves Centre for Wales. While not true "caving," it offers a fascinating glimpse into the underground world and is suitable for families. Prices vary, but expect to pay around £20 per adult for entry. Remember that during peak season (summer and school holidays), these sites can get busy, so booking in advance is highly recommended.

## Choosing the Right Caving Experience

Different caving experiences cater to various skill levels and preferences. Here's a quick guide:

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Go Below Challenge | Thrill-seekers, adventurous types | Strenuous | Conwy |
| Dan yr Ogof Showcaves | Families, beginners | Easy | Brecon Beacons |
| Black Mountain Activities Caving | Groups, team-building | Moderate | Brecon |

## Practical Tips

- Wear old clothes you don't mind getting ruined; caving is a dirty business!
- Bring a spare set of clothes and a towel for afterwards – you WILL want them.
- Check the weather forecast. Heavy rainfall can affect cave conditions and potentially lead to cancellations.
- Book well in advance, especially if you're visiting during peak season. Popular operators like Go Below and TYF Adventure fill up quickly.
