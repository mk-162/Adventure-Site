  "description": "Since 1844, every second Saturday in September, Usk Farmers' Club has hosted what's become one of the biggest one-day agricultural shows in the entire UK. Spread across 100 acres near picturesque Gwernesney, the show features eleven competition sections—from cattle and sheep to showjumping and the ever-popular companion dog show. Marvel at Bob Hogg's legendary Dog & Duck display, browse 300+ trade stands, and feast your way through the craft marquee and food market. It's Monmouthshire farming at its finest, with enough attractions to keep the whole family entertained from gates-open at 8am. This charming show features livestock competitions, craft exhibitions, vintage machinery, and family entertainment, drawing visitors from across Monmouthshire and the Welsh Borders.",
