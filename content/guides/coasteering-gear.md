# What to Wear Coasteering

Coasteering in Wales is an exhilarating experience, plunging into the rugged coastline's wild beauty. However, the unforgiving nature of the sea and rocks demands respect and, crucially, the right gear. Proper attire ensures warmth, protection, and freedom of movement, allowing you to fully enjoy the adventure while staying safe from the elements and potential hazards. This guide will detail the essential clothing and equipment for a memorable and secure coasteering experience along the Welsh coast.

## Essential Kit

### Wetsuit
A well-fitting wetsuit is arguably the most important piece of coasteering gear. Look for a full-length wetsuit, ideally 3-5mm thick, to provide adequate insulation against the cold Welsh waters. Consider wetsuits designed specifically for watersports, as these often feature reinforced knees and elbows. Ensure the suit fits snugly but allows for a full range of motion; a suit that’s too tight will restrict movement, while one that’s too loose will allow cold water to flush through.

### Buoyancy Aid
A buoyancy aid, also known as a Personal Flotation Device (PFD), is essential for safety and provides crucial assistance in the water. Make sure it fits correctly; it should be snug but allow freedom of movement and not ride up when you're in the water. Look for a buoyancy aid specifically designed for watersports, offering a good balance of buoyancy and mobility. Your coasteering operator will typically provide this, but it's vital to ensure it fits correctly.

### Coasteering Helmet
Protecting your head is paramount when navigating rocky coastlines. A coasteering helmet, similar to a climbing helmet but designed for water use, is crucial. Ensure it fits snugly and securely, covering your forehead and the back of your head. Look for a helmet with good ventilation to prevent overheating and ensure it's CE-certified for watersports use.

### Appropriate Footwear
Proper footwear provides grip and protection on slippery rocks. Old trainers are not ideal. Ideally, you want specialist coasteering boots, or sturdy wetsuit boots with a good, grippy sole. Avoid sandals or flip-flops, as they offer no protection or support. Consider neoprene socks to wear inside your boots for added warmth and comfort. Look for features such as ankle support and reinforced toes.

## Nice to Have

- **Gloves:** Neoprene gloves offer added warmth and grip, especially during colder months.
- **Rash Vest:** Worn under your wetsuit, a rash vest can prevent chafing and provide an extra layer of warmth.
- **Waterproof Camera:** Capture the stunning scenery, but ensure it's securely attached to you.
- **Dry Bag:** For storing personal items like keys or phones, though it's best to leave valuables on shore.

## What to Leave at Home

- **Jewellery:** Rings, necklaces, and bracelets can get snagged and lost.
- **Valuable Electronics:** Unless completely waterproof and securely attached, leave expensive electronics behind.

## Hire vs Buy

Many coasteering operators in Wales provide wetsuits, buoyancy aids, and helmets as part of their packages. It's generally more cost-effective to hire these items, especially if you're only coasteering once. However, if you plan on coasteering regularly, investing in your own wetsuit, boots, and helmet may be worthwhile for a better fit and higher quality.

## Budget Options

For budget-conscious coasteerers, focus on investing in a good quality wetsuit and footwear, as these are crucial for safety and comfort. You can often find deals on previous-season wetsuits or purchase used equipment in good condition. Consider borrowing a buoyancy aid and helmet from friends or family if possible.
