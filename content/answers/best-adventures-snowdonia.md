# What are the best adventure activities in Snowdonia?

## Quick Answer

Snowdonia (Eryri) is an adventure playground! For adrenaline junkies, try Zip World's Velocity 2, the fastest zip line in the world, or tackle a via ferrata at Honister Slate Mine just over the border in the Lake District. If you prefer your adventures a bit more grounded, hike to the summit of Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) via the challenging Crib Goch route, or explore the stunning coastline by coasteering with companies like TYF Adventure.

## Scaling the Heights: Hiking and Climbing

Snowdonia offers hikes for every ability, but for a true adventure, tackle Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) itself. The Llanberis Path is the most popular and easiest route, but for experienced hikers, Crib Goch offers a thrilling scramble with breathtaking views. Be warned: Crib Goch is not for the faint of heart and requires a head for heights and good weather conditions. Alternatively, try the Snowdon Ranger Path for a quieter, more scenic ascent. Guided hikes are available from companies like RAW Adventures, with prices starting around £60 per person. For rock climbing enthusiasts, honed routes in the Ogwen Valley offer classic climbs for all skill levels.

For a less strenuous but equally rewarding experience, explore the Glyderau range. The iconic Cantilever Stone and the dramatic Castell y Gwynt (Castle of the Winds) are highlights. Be prepared for some scrambling, and check the weather forecast before you go, as conditions can change rapidly.

## Coastal Thrills: Coasteering and Watersports

The Snowdonia coastline offers incredible opportunities for adventure. Coasteering, which involves traversing the coastline by swimming, scrambling, and jumping, is a fantastic way to explore hidden coves and sea caves. TYF Adventure in Porthmadog offers coasteering trips from around £55 per person, providing all the necessary equipment and expert guidance.

If you prefer being on the water, head to Llyn Tegid (Bala Lake), the largest natural lake in Wales, for kayaking, paddleboarding, or windsurfing. Bala Watersports offers equipment rental and lessons, with kayak rentals starting from around £20 per hour. For a more adrenaline-fueled experience, try canyoning with companies like Adventure Parc Snowdonia, which combines hiking, scrambling, and waterfall rappelling.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Crib Goch Ascent | Experienced hikers seeking a thrill | Very Challenging | Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) |
| Coasteering with TYF | Adventurous explorers of all levels | Moderate | Porthmadog & Anglesey |
| Kayaking on Llyn Tegid | Families and watersports enthusiasts | Easy to Moderate | Bala |

## Practical Tips

- Book activities in advance, especially during peak season (summer months and school holidays), to avoid disappointment.
- Parking at popular trailheads like Pen-y-Pass (for Snowdon) fills up quickly. Arrive early or use the Snowdon Sherpa bus service.
- Check the weather forecast before heading out, and be prepared for sudden changes in conditions, especially at higher elevations. Mountain weather can be very different to that in the valley.
- Pack appropriate clothing and footwear. Layers are essential, and sturdy hiking boots are a must for most activities.
- Learn some basic Welsh phrases to enhance your experience and show respect for the local culture. "Diolch" (thank you) goes a long way!
