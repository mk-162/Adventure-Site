# Pembrokeshire Coasteering Break

## Who This Trip Is For

This trip is perfect for adventurous families with kids aged 8+ who are comfortable in the water and enjoy a physical challenge. You'll need a decent level of swimming ability and a willingness to try new things. If you prefer gentle strolls to adrenaline rushes, or if anyone in your group is easily cold or gets seasick, this might not be the best fit.

## The Route Logic

This itinerary focuses on the north Pembrokeshire coast, specifically around St. Davids, as it offers the most concentrated selection of adventure activities. We'll start with coasteering to get the heart pumping, then offer a calmer option on day two. The order is designed to build confidence and let you adjust your activity level for the second day depending on how you feel. Be aware that travelling between locations in Pembrokeshire can take longer than expected due to narrow roads.

## Day 1: Cliff Jumping & Coastal Exploration

### The Plan

Today is all about getting wet and wild! We'll start with a coasteering session near St Davids to explore the coastline from a unique perspective. The afternoon is free for exploring St Davids itself.

**Morning:** Coasteering Classic at St. Davids (with TYF Adventure)
- What to expect: Prepare for scrambling over rocks, swimming in the sea, and jumping off cliffs (optional, of course!). The water will be cold, even in summer, so a good wetsuit is essential (provided by TYF).
- Suitability: Kids will love this, but they need to be confident swimmers and not afraid of a bit of a shock from the cold water. Adults need to be reasonably fit to clamber over slippery rocks. People with knee problems might struggle.

**Afternoon:** Explore St Davids
- Practical details: St Davids is the UK's smallest city. It's a charming place to wander around, visit St Davids Cathedral, or grab an ice cream. Parking in St Davids can be a nightmare in peak season. Use the Park & Ride from Oriel y Parc National Park Visitor Centre to avoid circling for hours.

**Base for the night:** St Davids area
- Why here: St Davids is a central location for accessing many of the adventure activities and has a good range of accommodation options. Staying here minimizes driving time on the first and second day.

## Day 2: Paddles & Puffins (Optional)

### The Plan

Today offers a choice between a relaxing sea kayaking trip or a wildlife boat tour. Opt for the kayaking if you enjoyed the water activities yesterday, or choose the boat tour for a more relaxed pace and a chance to see some amazing wildlife.

**Morning:** Choose Your Adventure:
- **Option 1:** Sea Kayaking Safari (with TYF Adventure) from St Davids
    - What to expect: A guided kayak tour along the Pembrokeshire coast, exploring hidden coves and sea caves. You'll need to paddle for a few hours, so some upper body strength is useful.
    - Suitability: Suitable for families and beginners, but requires a basic level of fitness. If the weather is rough, this can be hard work.
- **Option 2:** Boat Trip - Ramsey Island (with Preseli Venture or similar) from St Justinians
    - What to expect: A boat trip to Ramsey Island to see seals, seabirds (including puffins in season - May-July), and stunning coastal scenery. The boats can be bouncy, so be prepared if you're prone to seasickness.
    - Suitability: Excellent for families with younger children and those who prefer a more relaxed experience.

**Afternoon:** Coastal Walk
- Practical details: Whichever activity you choose in the morning, take some time to explore the Pembrokeshire Coast Path in the afternoon. There are stunning walks in both the St Davids and St Justinians areas. Remember to check tide times if you're planning to walk on any beaches.

**Base for the night:** Consider staying another night in St Davids, or move south towards Tenby if you plan to explore that area next.

## Know Before You Go

### Weather Reality

Pembrokeshire weather is notoriously unpredictable. Sunshine, rain, and wind can all occur within the same hour. The coast is exposed, so be prepared for strong winds, especially in spring and autumn. Sea kayaking and boat trips are heavily weather-dependent; always check the forecast and be prepared for cancellations. Rain doesn't necessarily stop coasteering, but high winds or big swells will.

### Traffic & Timing

Traffic on the A487, the main road through Pembrokeshire, can be heavy in peak season (July/August and school holidays). Allow extra time for travel, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. Parking at popular coastal spots like St Davids and St Justinians is limited, so arrive early or use park-and-ride services.

### Fitness Check

"Moderate" difficulty here means you need to be reasonably fit. Coasteering involves swimming, scrambling over rocks, and potentially jumping from heights. Sea kayaking requires upper body strength and stamina. If you're not used to physical activity, start with shorter, easier activities and build up gradually.

### Best Time of Year

The best time to visit Pembrokeshire for outdoor activities is late spring (May/June) or early autumn (September/October). The weather is often milder than in the summer peak, and the crowds are smaller. July and August can be glorious, but expect higher prices and more traffic. Avoid winter (November-February) as many activities are closed, and the weather can be harsh.

## Cost Reality

*   **Coasteering:** £50-£75 per person
*   **Sea Kayaking:** £50-£95 per person
*   **Boat Trip to Ramsey Island:** £45-£65 per person

These prices are approximate and depend on the operator and the duration of the activity. Remember to factor in the cost of travel, parking, and any equipment hire.
