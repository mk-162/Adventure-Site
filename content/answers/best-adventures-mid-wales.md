# What are the best adventure activities in Mid Wales?

## Quick Answer

Mid Wales is an adventure playground! Try mountain biking in Coed y Brenin Forest Park, exploring the caves at Dan-yr-Ogof, or hiking to the summit of Pen y Fan (although technically just outside Mid Wales, it's a must-do). For water adventures, the River Wye offers fantastic kayaking and canoeing.

## Mountain Biking in Coed y Brenin

Coed y Brenin Forest Park, near Dolgellau, is a mecca for mountain bikers of all levels. It boasts a network of trails, from gentle family routes to challenging black-graded runs for experienced riders. Expect to pay around £7-£10 for parking. Several local companies offer bike hire, including Beics Brenin, with prices starting around £30 per day. The trails are generally rideable year-round, but be prepared for muddy conditions in the winter months. Check Natural Resources Wales (NRW) website for trail closures and updates.

For a less crowded experience, consider the Dyfi Forest near Machynlleth. It offers more natural, less manicured trails, ideal for experienced riders looking for a challenge. Note that parking can be more limited here.

## Caving at Dan-yr-Ogof

Dan-yr-Ogof, the National Showcaves Centre for Wales, offers a fascinating glimpse into the underground world. Located in the Brecon Beacons National Park, it features three different caves to explore, each with unique geological formations. Tickets cost around £20 per adult. While the show caves are accessible to most, some sections require stooping and navigating narrow passages. The site is open year-round, but check the website for seasonal opening times. For a wilder caving experience, contact a local adventure company like Call of the Wild, who offer guided tours of less accessible cave systems (prices vary considerably depending on the trip).

## Practical Tips

- Park at Pont ar Elan visitor centre and hike up Craig Goch dam for incredible views of the Elan Valley reservoirs. It's free, but arrive early during peak season as the car park fills up quickly.
- The River Wye is prone to flooding, especially during the winter months. Always check river conditions before heading out on a kayak or canoe trip. Wye Valley Canoes in Glasbury-on-Wye provides up-to-date information.
- Book activities in advance, especially during school holidays. Popular operators like Adventure Beyond get fully booked weeks ahead.
- Wear appropriate footwear for hiking. The trails in Mid Wales can be rocky and uneven.
