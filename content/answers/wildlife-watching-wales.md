# Where Can I See Puffins, Seals, and Dolphins in Wales?

Skomer Island for puffins (May–July), Cardigan Bay for dolphins (year-round, best June–September), and Ramsey Island for grey seals (especially pupping season in autumn). Wales is one of the best places in Britain for marine wildlife — and you don't need a boat for most of it.

## Puffins

**Skomer Island, Pembrokeshire** — This is the big one. Skomer hosts around 22,000 puffin pairs and they're absurdly tame — you'll be sitting on the path with puffins waddling past your feet. The island is managed by the Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales. Day boats run from Martin's Haven from April to September, but puffins are reliably on the island from late April to mid-July.

Book early. Skomer day trips sell out weeks in advance, especially in June. Tickets cost around £25 for adults (plus the £20 landing fee). There's also an extremely limited overnight stay option at the old farmhouse — if you can get a spot, the evening light on the island is magical.

**Skokholm Island** — Skomer's quieter neighbour. Fewer puffins but a genuine wilderness feel. Weekly stays available rather than day trips.

**South Stack, Anglesey** — RSPB reserve on the western tip of [Anglesey](/anglesey). Puffins nest on the cliffs here from April to July. Not as close-up as Skomer, but the cliff scenery is spectacular and you don't need a boat crossing.

## Dolphins

**Cardigan Bay** — Home to the largest resident population of bottlenose dolphins in the UK. Around 300 animals live in these waters year-round. The best viewing spots:

- **New Quay, Ceredigion** — Walk out on the pier and you'll often see dolphins from dry land. Boat trips run from the harbour (£15–£25) with very high sighting rates in summer.
- **Mwnt Beach, Ceredigion** — Dolphins regularly feed close to shore. Bring binoculars and patience.
- **Strumble Head, Pembrokeshire** — Excellent land-based viewing point. Porpoises are almost guaranteed; dolphins frequent.

**Kayaking with dolphins** is possible from New Quay — several operators offer guided trips. You're not guaranteed to paddle alongside them, but the chances are genuinely good between June and September.

## Seals

**Ramsey Island, Pembrokeshire** — Grey seal pupping season runs from late August through October. Boat trips from St Davids circle the island and you'll see dozens of seals hauled out on the rocks, with white-coated pups in autumn. Trips cost around £30–£40.

**Skomer and the Marloes Peninsula** — Seals are present year-round, but autumn is best for pups.

**Bardsey Island, Llŷn Peninsula** — Remote and magical. Grey seals breed here in good numbers. Boat crossings run from Aberdaron when conditions allow.

## Red Kites (Bonus)

You can't write about Welsh wildlife without mentioning red kites. Once nearly extinct, Wales now has hundreds of breeding pairs. The **Gigrin Farm feeding station** near Rhayader in [Mid Wales](/mid-wales) is the best place to see them — up to 600 kites descend for the daily afternoon feed. Admission around £8. Utterly spectacular.
