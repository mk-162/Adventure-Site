# Horse Riding & Pony Trekking in Wales

Wales and horses go way back. The Welsh Mountain Pony has roamed these hills for centuries, and the country's network of bridleways — over 600 miles in the Brecon Beacons alone — makes it one of the best places in Britain to ride. Forget the sterile indoor arena: here you're trotting along mountain ridgelines with views that go on for miles, fording streams, and occasionally sharing the trail with wild ponies who were here long before you.

Whether you're a complete beginner wanting a gentle hour on a sure-footed cob, or an experienced rider looking for a multi-day trans-Wales adventure, there's something here for you.

## What to Expect

Most Welsh riding centres offer a range of experiences:

- **Pony rides** (20–30 mins) — Perfect for young children, usually led by staff. From around £10–15.
- **Hour rides** — The sweet spot for beginners and families. Typically around £25–35. You'll get basic instruction and a guided ride around the farm or along bridleways.
- **Half-day treks** (2–3 hours) — More adventurous routes into the hills. £35–50. Some riding experience helpful but not always required.
- **Full-day rides** (5–6 hours) — Serious mountain trekking with packed lunch stops and panoramic views. £55–70. Usually requires some experience.
- **Multi-day riding holidays** — Trans Wales Trails and similar operators offer 2–5 day adventures with accommodation included. The ultimate Welsh riding experience. Expect £200–400+ per person for a weekend break, all-inclusive.

## Where to Ride

### Brecon Beacons (Best for Variety)
The heartland of Welsh riding. The Brecon Beacons has more bridleways per square mile than almost anywhere in the UK. Cantref Riding Centre is the only centre licensed to trek on the Beacons themselves — their Welsh Pony Trail Ride follows the paths of wild mountain ponies up to the high ridges. Grange Trekking near Abergavenny specialises in Black Mountain rides on sturdy Welsh cobs, with views that stretch to the Usk Valley and beyond. Tregoyd Mountain Riders offers riding holidays in the Black Mountains with self-catering cottages on site. [Explore the Brecon Beacons](/brecon-beacons)

### Mid Wales (Best for Solitude)
Quieter trails, bigger skies, nobody around. Trans Wales Trails operates from a traditional Welsh longhouse near Caersws, offering fully inclusive weekend breaks with two full days' riding through rolling countryside that feels genuinely remote. This is riding for people who want to switch off completely. [Explore Mid Wales](/mid-wales)

### Snowdonia (Best for Scenery)
Mountain riding with dramatic backdrops — slate valleys, glacial lakes, and the Snowdon massif in the distance. Several centres offer rides through Snowdonia's lower valleys and foothills. The terrain is more varied (and occasionally more demanding) than the Beacons. [Explore Snowdonia](/snowdonia)

### Pembrokeshire (Best for Coast)
Beach rides and cliff-top trails with the Irish Sea stretching out below you. Some centres combine coast and countryside in a single ride — canter along the sand in the morning, wind through coastal woodland in the afternoon. There's nothing quite like riding at the water's edge on a Pembrokeshire beach. [Explore Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire)

## Top Recommendations

1. **Cantref Riding Centre, Brecon Beacons** — The Welsh Pony Trail Ride (full day) is the signature experience. Also brilliant for families with their "Own a Pony" days where kids groom, tack up and ride.
2. **Grange Trekking, Abergavenny** — Half-day Black Mountains trek on Welsh cobs. Stunning scenery, well-matched horses, proper mountain riding.
3. **Trans Wales Trails, Mid Wales** — Weekend riding holidays from a longhouse. Meals, accommodation and two full days in the saddle. Worth every penny for intermediate+ riders.
4. **Tregoyd Mountain Riders, Black Mountains** — Multi-day riding breaks with self-catering cottages. Good for groups wanting a riding-focused weekend.

## What to Bring

- **Long trousers** — jeans are fine, though they can chafe on longer rides. Jodhpurs if you have them.
- **Boots or wellies** with a small heel (trainers are a no-go — your foot can slip through the stirrup).
- **Layers on top** — it's always cooler on the mountain than in the car park.
- **Waterproof jacket** — you're in Wales. Rides go ahead in light rain.
- **Riding hats** are provided by all centres. No need to bring your own unless you prefer to.

## Safety Considerations

- **Weight limits**: Most centres have a rider weight limit of around 14–16 stone (89–102 kg). Always check when booking — it's about horse welfare, not judgement.
- **Minimum age**: Varies by centre. Pony rides from age 3–4, longer rides typically from age 6–8. Under-18s need parental consent.
- **Experience matching**: Be honest about your ability. Centres match horses to riders and it genuinely matters. A nervous beginner on a forward horse isn't fun for anyone.
- **Weather cancellations**: Heavy rain or high winds may cause cancellations. Light rain? You're in Wales — crack on.

## Best Time to Visit

- **Spring (April–May)**: Wildflowers on the trails, lambs in the fields, pleasant temperatures. Can still be muddy after winter.
- **Summer (June–August)**: Longest daylight, warmest weather, busiest period. Book well ahead for school holiday slots.
- **Autumn (September–October)**: Stunning colours, quieter trails, crisp riding weather. Perhaps the best time if you have the choice.
- **Winter (November–March)**: Many centres operate year-round but with reduced hours. Shorter rides only. Exhilarating on a clear, frosty day.

## Who It's For

Horse riding in Wales suits almost everyone. The Welsh cob is famously gentle and sure-footed — ideal for nervous beginners who want to feel safe rather than terrified. But the terrain and the variety of rides mean experienced riders absolutely won't be bored. It's particularly popular with families (kids love the Own a Pony days at Cantref), couples looking for something different from the usual weekend away, and solo riders who want to disappear into the mountains for a few hours. Groups often combine it with a pub lunch — several centres are handily close to excellent country pubs.
