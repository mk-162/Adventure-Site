# Is Brecon Beacons good for families with children?

## Quick Answer

Absolutely! The Brecon Beacons National Park offers a fantastic range of activities suitable for families with children of all ages. From gentle canal walks and accessible trails to more challenging hikes and exciting outdoor adventures, there's something to keep everyone entertained, plus plenty of family-friendly pubs and cafes to refuel.

## Family-Friendly Adventures in the Beacons

The Brecon Beacons is brilliant for getting kids into the outdoors. For younger children, the Talybont Reservoir is ideal for a flat, easy walk with stunning views. You can hire bikes from the Talybont-on-Usk village and cycle along the canal towpath, spotting wildlife along the way. For slightly older kids, consider a walk to Henrhyd Falls (Welsh: Sgwd Henrhyd), the highest waterfall in South Wales – it's a relatively short but rewarding hike, and you can even walk behind the falls!

For a more structured adventure, check out the family activities offered by companies like Parkwood Outdoors Dolygaer near Merthyr Tydfil. They offer everything from canoeing and kayaking on the Pontsticill Reservoir to climbing and bushcraft sessions, with prices starting around £30 per person. In terms of seasonal considerations, the spring and summer months offer the best weather for outdoor activities, but the autumn colours can be spectacular, and winter brings opportunities for crisp, frosty walks (just be prepared for muddy conditions!).

## Exploring Caves and Castles

Beyond hiking and watersports, the Brecon Beacons boasts fascinating caves and castles that appeal to families. Dan-yr-Ogof, the National Showcaves Centre for Wales, offers a captivating underground experience with three different caves to explore, plus a dinosaur park and other attractions. Tickets cost around £20 per adult and £15 per child.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Talybont Reservoir Walk | Younger children, easy cycling | Easy | Talybont-on-Usk |
| Henrhyd Falls Hike | Adventurous families, waterfall views | Moderate | Coelbren |
| Dan-yr-Ogof Caves | Exploring underground, dinosaur fans | Easy to Moderate | Abercraf |

## Practical Tips

- Always check the weather forecast before heading out, and be prepared for sudden changes, especially in the hills. Layers are key!
- Parking at popular spots like Pen y Fan can fill up quickly, especially during peak season. Arrive early or consider using the park-and-ride service from Brecon.
- Many pubs and cafes in the Brecon Beacons offer children's menus and play areas. The Felin Fach Griffin near Brecon is a great option for a family-friendly meal.
- If you're planning a longer hike, make sure you have appropriate footwear, plenty of water, and snacks. A map and compass (or a GPS device) are also essential.
