# Paintball & Laser Tag in Wales

Sometimes you just want to shoot your mates in the woods. No judgement. Wales has a solid selection of paintball and laser tag venues, mostly clustered around South Wales (handy for the Cardiff stag do crowd) but with options in North Wales and Pembrokeshire too.

## What's the Difference?

### Paintball
The classic. Real paintball guns, real paint, real bruises. You'll wear overalls and a full-face mask, and spend a few hours running around woodland game zones trying to outflank the opposing team. Expect to get hit — it stings for a second but most people are laughing too hard to care.

- **Age**: Usually 11+ for paintball (some sites do junior versions with lower-impact markers for ages 8+).
- **Cost**: From around £15–25 per person for a half-day session, plus paintballs (typically £5–8 per 100). Budget £40–60 per person for a decent session with enough ammo.
- **Duration**: Half-day (2–3 hours of games) or full day.

### Laser Tag
The pain-free alternative. Electronic guns, sensors on your vest, no mess, no bruises. Better for younger groups, corporate days, and anyone who'd rather not explain a paintball welt to their other half.

- **Age**: Usually 8+, making it much more family-friendly.
- **Cost**: Typically £15–25 per person.
- **Duration**: Usually 1–2 hours of games.

## Where to Play

### South Wales (Most Options)

**Taskforce Paintball, Cowbridge** — South Wales' longest-running paintball site. 30-acre woodland course with multiple game zones. Also offers laser tag, archery and laser clay shooting. Just off the M4, about 20 minutes from Cardiff.

**Adventures Wales, Porthcawl** — Speedball arena paintball and laser tag. Popular for stag and hen parties. Also offers a huge range of other activities (quad biking, gorge walking, surfing) so you can build a full day package.

**Bedlam Paintball, Cowbridge** — Well-established woodland site near Cardiff. Multiple game scenarios. Also operates laser tag.

### Pembrokeshire

**Heatherton World of Activities** — Family activity park near Tenby with paintball among its many offerings. Also has go-karting, bumper boats, escape rooms and more. Good for families who want variety.

### North Wales

Several activity centres in North Wales offer paintball as part of multi-activity packages, particularly aimed at stag parties and group weekends.

## Practical Tips

- **What to wear**: Old clothes you don't mind getting dirty (paintball) or comfortable active wear (laser tag). Layers are good — you'll warm up running around. Sturdy footwear essential; the ground is usually muddy.
- **Booking**: Essential for groups. Walk-in sessions available at some sites on weekends.
- **Group discounts**: Standard at most venues. Stag/hen packages from around £25–40 per person including extras.
- **Bruises**: Yes, paintball does leave bruises. They're usually small and on your arms/torso. Wear a thick hoodie under your overalls if you bruise easily.
- **Weather**: Games run in the rain — arguably more fun when it's muddy. Only lightning or extreme conditions cause cancellations.

## Who It's For

- **Stag & hen parties**: The classic choice. Most venues offer packages with add-ons.
- **Birthday parties**: Laser tag is huge for kids' birthdays (ages 8+). Paintball for teens (11+).
- **Corporate team building**: Nothing bonds a team like eliminating the accounts department.
- **Families**: Laser tag works for mixed-age groups. Junior paintball at some venues for younger kids.
- **Just because**: Sometimes a Saturday shooting things in the woods is exactly what you need.

## Best Time to Visit

Year-round activity — this is one of the few things in Wales that actually benefits from miserable weather (mud makes it more fun). Summer weekends are busiest; midweek sessions are quieter and sometimes cheaper.
