  "introduction": "Pembrokeshire didn't just popularise coasteering — it invented it. TYF Adventure in St Davids pioneered the sport in the 1980s, and the coastline between St Davids and Fishguard remains the best place in the world to throw yourself off cliffs into the sea.\n\nThe Pembrokeshire coast serves up everything: sea caves you can swim through, natural arches, blowholes, deep-water cliff jumps, and marine wildlife encounters that feel genuinely wild. Grey seals, porpoises, and puffins (on boat trips to nearby islands) are all common.\n\nYou cannot coasteer these spots independently — this is a guided activity requiring local knowledge of tides, swells, and the specific hazards at each location. All entries below include the operators who run sessions at each spot. Expect to pay £40-75 per person for a 3-4 hour session including all equipment.",
  "rankingCriteria": "We've coasteered all these spots with multiple operators. Rankings factor in the quality of cliff jumps, sea cave exploration, marine wildlife, overall drama of the coastline, and the quality of the operator experience. We favour spots that deliver genuine 'did that just happen?' moments.",

      "question": "Is coasteering safe for beginners?",
      "answer": "Yes — with a qualified operator. All jumps are optional and instructors assess conditions before every session. Abercastle (#6) and the beginner routes at Abereiddy (#1) are designed for nervous first-timers. You need to be a confident swimmer but no prior experience is required."
