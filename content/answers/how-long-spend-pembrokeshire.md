# How many days should I spend in Pembrokeshire?

## Quick Answer

To truly experience Pembrokeshire's diverse coastline and activities, aim for a minimum of three full days. A week gives you a much better opportunity to explore the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, try various watersports, and delve into the region's history and culture at a more relaxed pace. For serious hikers or those wanting to explore every nook and cranny, consider 7-10 days.

## Coastal Hiking and Watersports

Pembrokeshire is famed for its stunning coastline. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail offers 186 miles of breathtaking views, secluded coves, and challenging climbs. A three-day trip might allow you to tackle a popular section like the St. David's Head loop, while a week lets you explore further afield, perhaps combining hiking with kayaking or coasteering. TYF Adventure in St Davids offers excellent coasteering experiences from around £65 per person, allowing you to explore the coastline from a unique perspective. For a more relaxed experience, consider a boat trip to Ramsey Island to spot seals and seabirds; these typically cost around £30-£40. Remember that the coastal path can be challenging, with steep ascents and descents, so factor in your fitness level.

## History, Culture, and Relaxation

Beyond the coast, Pembrokeshire boasts historic sites like St Davids Cathedral and Pembroke Castle. A day trip to St Davids, the UK's smallest city, is a must. Pembroke Castle, with its Norman architecture, requires at least half a day to explore fully; entry is around £8.50 for adults. If relaxation is your priority, consider spending time on one of Pembrokeshire's many beaches. Barafundle Bay, often ranked among the UK's best, is perfect for a picnic and a swim (though parking can be limited). In the summer months, expect beaches to be busy, particularly on weekends and during school holidays.

## Practical Tips

- Book accommodation well in advance, especially during peak season (July-August) and bank holidays. Popular spots like Tenby and Saundersfoot fill up quickly.
- The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is exposed, so pack for all weather conditions, even in summer. Waterproofs, sunscreen, and a hat are essential.
- Public transport in Pembrokeshire can be limited, especially in rural areas. Consider renting a car to explore the region fully. Parking charges apply in most popular locations.
- Check tide times before planning coastal walks or activities, as some sections of the path are impassable at high tide.
