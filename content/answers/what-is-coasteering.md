# What is Coasteering?

## Quick Answer

Coasteering is an adventure activity where you traverse a rocky coastline by swimming, scrambling, climbing, and jumping off cliffs into the sea. You wear a wetsuit, buoyancy aid, and helmet. It was essentially invented in Pembrokeshire, and Wales remains one of the best places in the world to do it.

## The Detail

Coasteering is more than just a walk along the beach — it's exploring the bit of coastline you'd normally only see from above. A typical session involves:

*   **Kitting up:** Full wetsuit (you'll need it — Welsh water is cold even in August), buoyancy aid, and helmet. Most operators provide everything except swimwear and old trainers.
*   **Coastal traversing:** Following a guide, you'll scramble across rocks, wade through channels, and swim between sections. You'll use your hands, feet, and occasionally your courage.
*   **Cliff jumping:** The signature element. Jumps range from 1-metre "steps" to 8-metre+ leaps for the genuinely brave. Always optional — no reputable guide will pressure you. They check depth and conditions before every jump.
*   **Sea caves and gullies:** Many routes thread through sea caves, narrow gullies, and natural arches. At Abereiddy's Blue Lagoon in Pembrokeshire, you might swim into caves carved from volcanic rock.
*   **Wildlife encounters:** Seals are common in Pembrokeshire and Anglesey. You'll see them bobbing in the water watching you as curiously as you're watching them.

### What makes it different from other water activities?

Coasteering combines elements of swimming, rock climbing, and cliff jumping into one session. Unlike [kayaking](/activities/kayaking) (where you stay in a boat) or [surfing](/activities/surfing) (where you're riding waves), coasteering puts you right at the interface between land and sea. It's more physical than a [wild swim](/activities/wild-swimming) and more varied than a beach day. The closest comparison is [gorge walking](/activities/gorge-walking), but in saltwater along the coast rather than freshwater in a river canyon.

## Where to Go Coasteering in Wales

*   **Pembrokeshire:** The birthplace of coasteering and still the best. The Blue Lagoon at Abereiddy, the cliffs around St Davids, and the bays near Solva offer incredible coastline. Crystal-clear water, dramatic geology, and the highest concentration of operators in Wales. [Find coasteering in Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/coasteering).
*   **Anglesey:** Different character — sea caves, narrow gullies, and interesting rock formations. Rhoscolyn is particularly good. Less crowded than Pembrokeshire. [Find coasteering in Anglesey](/anglesey/things-to-do/coasteering).
*   **Gower Peninsula:** Closer to Cardiff and Swansea. Beautiful coastline, though perhaps not quite as dramatic as Pembrokeshire. Good if you don't want to travel far west. [Find coasteering on the Gower](/gower/things-to-do/coasteering).
*   **Llŷn Peninsula:** More remote, fewer people, equally stunning. The coasteering around Aberdaron is wild and beautiful.

## What You'll Need

Operators provide the wetsuit, buoyancy aid, and helmet. You bring:
*   **Swimsuit or quick-drying underwear** (worn under the wetsuit)
*   **Old trainers** with reasonable grip — they'll get battered
*   **A towel and warm clothes** for afterwards (you will be cold)
*   **A sense of humour** — you'll probably get a face full of seaweed at some point

## Best Time to Go

May to October, with June-September being prime season. Water temperatures range from about 10°C in May to 16°C in August. Even in "peak summer" the water is bracing — that's part of the experience. [Read more about the best time for coasteering](/answers/best-time-coasteering-wales).

## The Smart Choice

If you're looking for an adrenaline-filled adventure that combines physical challenges with stunning coastal scenery, coasteering is one of the best things you can do in Wales. Choose Pembrokeshire for the classic experience. Start with a standard "classic" session if you're nervous — the jumps are smaller and the route less exposed. For a less intense coastal experience, try [sea kayaking](/activities/kayaking). If you prefer freshwater and enclosed gorges, [gorge walking](/activities/gorge-walking) might be a better fit.
