One of Europe's finest prime stock shows meets Wales's most spectacular Christmas shopping experience across two packed days.

From artisan gifts to farming equipment, from mulled wine to prize-winning Welsh lamb—the Winter Fair is where farming, food, and festivities collide in the most wonderfully Welsh way possible.",
