  "introduction": "Pembrokeshire picks up more swell than almost anywhere else in Wales. Facing west into the Atlantic, its beaches and reefs catch everything from clean groundswells to storm-driven chaos. It's not as consistent as Cornwall and the water's colder, but when it's on, spots like Freshwater West and Whitesands can genuinely rival anything in the UK.\n\nThe coastline throws up everything from mellow beach breaks perfect for learning to heavy reef setups that demand respect. Our picks mix accessible spots with a few that reward local knowledge and early starts. Water temps range from 8°C (winter) to 17°C (late summer), so bring a decent wetsuit year-round — 4/3mm minimum, 5/4mm from October to April.",
  "rankingCriteria": "We've surfed all of these spots across multiple seasons and conditions. Rankings factor in wave quality, consistency, crowd levels, facilities, and the overall experience. We favour spots where the wave quality genuinely justifies the journey.",

Gower has better-shaped waves at spots like Llangennith and more surf infrastructure. Pembrokeshire wins on scenery and solitude; Gower wins on consistency and convenience."
