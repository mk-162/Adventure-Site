# What are the hidden gems and secret spots in Brecon Beacons?

## Quick Answer

The Brecon Beacons (Bannau Brycheiniog) are full of secrets! Skip Pen y Fan and head to the quieter peaks of Fan y Big for incredible views, or explore the turquoise waters of Blaen y Glyn waterfalls. For a unique experience, try stargazing in the Bannau Brycheiniog National Park, an International Dark Sky Reserve.

## Waterfall Wonders and Wild Swimming

Beyond the popular Four Waterfalls Walk, the Brecon Beacons hide some truly stunning, less-visited cascades. Blaen y Glyn, near Talybont-on-Usk, offers a series of waterfalls and plunge pools perfect for wild swimming. Be warned, the water is bracing even in summer! For a longer hike, explore the waterfalls around Ystradfellte; Sgwd Ddwli is particularly magical, hidden in a wooded gorge. Remember to wear appropriate footwear as the rocks can be slippery, and always check water conditions before entering. Parking at Blaen y Glyn is limited, especially on weekends, so arrive early or consider visiting on a weekday.

For experienced canyoners, consider booking a trip with a local operator like Adventure Britain (based in Brecon, prices from £95 per person) to explore the more technical waterfall systems. They provide all the necessary equipment and expertise to navigate these challenging environments safely.

## Summit Solitude: Beyond Pen y Fan

While Pen y Fan is iconic, it's also incredibly crowded. For a more solitary summit experience, hike Fan y Big, just west of Pen y Fan. It offers equally stunning views across the central Beacons, including the distinctive "diving board" rock formation. The path is still challenging, but the relative lack of crowds makes it a far more rewarding experience. Another excellent option is Waun Rydd, the highest point in the Black Mountains. The ascent is gentler than Pen y Fan, and the panoramic views from the top are breathtaking.

If you're looking for a multi-day trek, consider the Beacons Way, a 99-mile trail that traverses the entire National Park. While not exactly "hidden," tackling sections of it allows you to escape the day-tripper crowds and discover the true wilderness of the Brecon Beacons.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Blaen y Glyn Waterfalls | Wild swimming and short hikes | Moderate | Near Talybont-on-Usk |
| Fan y Big | Stunning views with fewer crowds | Challenging | West of Pen y Fan |
| Waun Rydd | Gentle ascent and panoramic views | Moderate | Black Mountains |

## Practical Tips

- Download an offline map of the area before you go, as phone signal can be unreliable in many parts of the Brecon Beacons.
- Pack layers, even in summer. The weather in the mountains can change rapidly.
- Support local businesses by buying your hiking snacks and supplies in towns like Brecon or Hay-on-Wye.
- Be aware of livestock. Keep dogs on leads, especially near sheep.
- Stargazing is best on clear, moonless nights. Check the weather forecast and moon phase before heading out.
