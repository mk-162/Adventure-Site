Good on you. But forget those Instagram influencers with their perfectly curated backpacks – you need to pack for *Wales*. That means rain, wind, and the distinct possibility of boggy terrain, even in summer. This isn't the Mediterranean, mate. This is Eryri, Bannau Brycheiniog, Cymru. Here’s the gear I actually rely on, and some honest advice on what's worth buying, and what you can get away with hiring.\n\n## The Essentials: Shelter, Sleep, and Food\n\nFirst, the basics. You’ll need somewhere to sleep, something to sleep in, and something to eat.\n\n*   **Tent:** Unless you’re planning on using bothies (basic mountain shelters), a tent is essential. For a weekend, a lightweight 2-person tent (£80-£300) should suffice, even if you’re solo – extra space is always welcome when you need to dry gear. Decathlon do some decent own-brand options, or you could look at Vango. Consider a 3-season tent as a minimum – Welsh weather can be brutal even in \"summer\".\n\n*   **Sleeping Bag:** Don't skimp on this. A 3-season sleeping bag (£60-£400) is a must. Pay attention to the comfort and limit temperatures. A bag rated to -5°C will be far more comfortable than one you're pushing to its limit. If you're only doing the odd trip, consider hiring one. Many outdoor shops in places like Betws-y-Coed or Abergavenny offer hire services.\n\n*   **Sleeping Mat:** Closed-cell foam mats (£15-£30) are cheap and reliable, but bulky. Inflatable mats (£40-£200) are more comfortable and pack smaller. Self-inflating mats are a good compromise. Decathlon's Forclaz range does the job.\n\n*   **Cooking:** A small gas stove (£20-£50) and a lightweight pot (£15-£40) are all you need for basic cooking. Don't forget a lighter or matches in a waterproof container. Pre-packaged meals are convenient, but bulky and can be expensive. Pasta, rice, and dried soup are lightweight and cheap. If you're near a village, stock up on local produce - makes all the difference to morale.\n\n*   **Water:** Carry at least 2 liters of water per day, more if you're hiking in hot weather (unlikely, but possible!). A hydration reservoir (£20-£40) is convenient, but bottles work just as well. A water filter or purification tablets (£10-£30) are essential if you're relying on streams or lakes – giardia isn’t a souvenir you want.\n\n## Clothing: Layers are Key\n\nWelsh weather is notoriously unpredictable. Layers are essential.\n\n*   **Base Layers:** Merino wool or synthetic base layers (£20-£60 per item) are ideal. They wick moisture away from your skin and keep you warm even when wet. Avoid cotton – it absorbs sweat and takes forever to dry.\n\n*   **Mid Layer:** A fleece jacket (£30-£80) or a lightweight insulated jacket (£60-£150) will provide warmth.\n\n*   **Waterproof Jacket:** A good quality waterproof jacket (£80-£300+) is non-negotiable. Look for a jacket with a high waterproof rating (at least 10,000mm) and taped seams. Brands like Berghaus, Rab, and Mountain Equipment are reliable, but can be pricey. Consider Decathlon again for cheaper options.\n\n*   **Waterproof Trousers:** Over-trousers (£30-£150) are essential if you're hiking in wet weather. Opt for full-length zips for easy on/off.\n\n*   **Hiking Boots:** Sturdy, waterproof hiking boots (£70-£250) are crucial for tackling Welsh terrain. Make sure they're well broken-in before your trip to avoid blisters. If you're sticking to well-maintained paths, trail running shoes might suffice, but boots offer better ankle support.\n\n*   **Socks:** Wool or synthetic hiking socks (£10-£20 per pair) are essential for preventing blisters. Pack several pairs.\n\n*   **Hat and Gloves:** Even in summer, a hat and gloves (£10-£30 each) are useful for cold mornings and evenings.\n\n## Navigation and Safety\n\nGetting lost in the Welsh mountains is no joke. Don't rely solely on your phone.\n\n*   **Map and Compass:** Learn how to use them! Ordnance Survey maps are essential for navigating in Wales. Get the relevant Explorer or Landranger map for your area. A compass (£15-£50) is useless without a map.\n\n*   **GPS Device or Phone with GPS:** A GPS device (£100-£400) is a useful backup, but don't rely on it entirely. Download offline maps to your phone in case you lose signal. Apps like Ordnance Survey Maps or ViewRanger are helpful.\n\n*   **First Aid Kit:** A basic first aid kit (£20-£50) should include bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, blister treatment, and any personal medications.\n\n*   **Headtorch:** A headtorch (£20-£60) is essential for navigating in the dark, whether you're night hiking or just stumbling around the campsite.\n\n*   **Whistle:** A whistle (£5-£10) can be used to signal for help in an emergency. Six short blasts, then a pause, then repeat.\n\n*   **Emergency Shelter:** A lightweight emergency shelter (£20-£50), like a survival bag or bivy sack, can provide protection from the elements in an emergency.\n\n## Backpack\n\n*   **Rucksack:** A 50-70 liter rucksack (£70-£250) should be large enough for a weekend camping trip. Choose a rucksack with a comfortable harness and hip belt. Distribute weight evenly and keep heavier items close to your back.\n\n## Extras\n\n*   **Sunscreen:** Even on cloudy days, the sun can be surprisingly strong in the mountains.\n*   **Insect Repellent:** Midges can be a nuisance, especially in wooded areas.\n*   **Toiletries:** Keep it simple. Biodegradable soap and a toothbrush are all you really need.\n*   **Rubbish Bags:** Pack it in, pack it out. Leave no trace.\n*   **Camera:** Capture those memories.\n*   **Book:** For relaxing in the tent or bothy.\n\n## Buying vs. Hiring\n\nFor occasional use, hiring gear can be a cost-effective option. Shops like Cotswold Outdoor and Go Outdoors offer gear hire services, as do many independent outdoor shops in popular tourist areas. If you're planning on doing a lot of hiking and camping, investing in your own gear is worth it in the long run.\n\n## Location Considerations\n\nYour gear choices will vary depending on where you're heading. A coastal hike in Pembrokeshire requires different gear than a mountain trek in Snowdonia. For example, if you're planning on trying coasteering with [TYF Adventure](https://www.tyf.com/) in Pembrokeshire, you won't need a tent, but you will want quick-drying clothes. Likewise, if you're tackling Crib Goch with a guide from [MountainXperience](https://www.mountainxperience.com/), you'll want sturdy boots and waterproofs. If you want to try something a little different, consider heading to the Brecon Beacons for some gorge walking with [Adventure Britain](https://www.adventurebritain.com/).\n\n## A Word on Parking\n\nBe prepared to pay for parking in popular areas. Snowdonia National Park has parking charges at many of its trailheads. Expect to pay around £6-£8 per day. Check the National Park Authority website for up-to-date information. Coed y Brenin forest park has parking fees of £2-7 depending on length of stay.\n\n## Seasonal Notes\n\n*   **Spring:** Expect rain and wind. Be prepared for sudden changes in weather.\n*   **Summer:** The best time for hiking and camping, but also the busiest. Book campsites in advance.\n*   **Autumn:** Beautiful colors, but shorter days and colder temperatures.\n*   **Winter:** Only for experienced hikers and mountaineers. Expect snow and ice.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nWales is a fantastic place for adventure, but it’s important to be prepared. Pack wisely, check the weather forecast, and let someone know your plans. Now get out there and enjoy it! And remember to pack a sense of humour – you’ll need it when the inevitable rain starts!",
