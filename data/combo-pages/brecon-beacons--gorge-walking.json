  "introduction": "The Brecon Beacons, famed as 'Waterfall Country', are a gorge walking paradise. Unlike gentler streams elsewhere, the rivers here carve through dramatic sandstone, creating deep gorges, cascading waterfalls, and exhilarating natural playgrounds. Forget a polite paddle; expect full immersion, scrambling, and the occasional adrenaline rush. This isn't just a walk; it's an adventure. \n\n**Gorge walking in Brecon Beacons** is primarily concentrated around the Mellte Valley, near Pontneddfechan, but you'll find incredible routes dotted throughout the park. The Four Falls Trail is a great starting point, but for a truly immersive experience, hiring a guide is highly recommended. They know the safest routes, hidden spots, and can provide the necessary equipment.\n\nThis activity is best suited for reasonably fit individuals who don't mind getting wet and aren't afraid of heights. While some sections can be tackled by families with older children (10+), the more challenging routes require experience and a head for heights. Be prepared for cold water, slippery rocks, and the occasional scramble up a waterfall. The reward? Unforgettable memories and bragging rights.\n\nHonesty time: gorge walking here isn't always sunshine and rainbows. The weather can change quickly, and the water levels can rise dramatically after heavy rain. Always check the forecast and listen to local advice. But when the conditions are right, there's no better way to experience the raw beauty of the Brecon Beacons.",
