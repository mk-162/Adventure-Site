## Tips for Surfing in Pembrokeshire

*   **Check the surf report:** Before heading out, always check the latest surf report for accurate wave height, swell direction, and tide information. Websites like Magicseaweed are invaluable resources.
*   **Consider a lesson:** If you're a beginner, consider taking a surfing lesson from a reputable surf school like TYF Adventure or Outer Reef Surf School. They'll provide you with the fundamentals and ensure your safety.
*   **Be aware of rips:** Rips are strong currents that can pull you away from the shore. If caught in a rip, don't panic. Swim parallel to the shore until you're out of the current, then swim back to the beach.
*   **Respect the locals:** Show respect to local surfers and be mindful of surfing etiquette. Don't drop in on other surfers and give way to those who are already riding a wave.
*   **Explore other activities:** Pembrokeshire is a haven for outdoor adventures. Combine your surfing trip with coasteering with TYF Adventure, sea kayaking with Preseli Venture, or hiking along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path.
