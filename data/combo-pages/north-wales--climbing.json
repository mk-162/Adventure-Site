  "introduction": "North Wales, mate, it's not just hills – it's a climber's playground. Forget the manicured holds of your local wall; we're talking about the raw grit of slate quarries, the sheer granite of the Llanberis Pass, and the exposed limestone sea cliffs of the Great Orme. This isn't climbing, it's an experience.\n\nWhat makes it special? Variety, pure and simple. One day you could be tackling multi-pitch trad routes on Dinas Cromlech, the next bouldering in the Ogwen Valley, and the next sport climbing above the crashing waves at Gogarth. The weather? Unpredictable, like a Welsh rugby match. Sunshine can turn to drizzle in minutes, so you need to be prepared.\n\nWho's it for? Everyone, really. There's beginner-friendly stuff at Tremadog (famous for its sunny aspect) and the indoor walls like Beacon Climbing Centre. But if you're chasing a proper challenge, the Pass and Gogarth will test your nerve and skill. Just remember, North Wales climbing is serious business. Be prepared, know your limits, and respect the mountains. And always, always have a backup plan for that inevitable downpour. Learning about climbing north wales will be one of the greatest experiences you can encounter.",
