  "description": "Claiming the extraordinary title of the oldest agricultural society in the United Kingdom (established 1755!), the Brecknockshire Agricultural Society's annual show is living history wrapped in a thoroughly modern family day out. Set against the magnificent Brecon Beacons, this one-day spectacular draws over 19,000 visitors to witness everything from traditional livestock judging to the death-defying Paul Hannam Quad Stunt Show. With 300+ trade stands, a fantastic food hall, vintage tractors, and the kids' favourites making appearances, it's 271 years of Welsh farming tradition served with contemporary flair.",
