This guide unveils some of the best hidden beaches, perfect for escaping the crowds and soaking up the Welsh seaside.\n\n# Hidden Beaches of Wales\n\nWales, eh? Known for its rain, sheep, and blokes who can hold a tune. But the best kept secret is the coastline. Forget the tourist traps of Tenby and Llandudno (though they have their place), and let's talk about the beaches that require a bit more effort, the ones where you're more likely to share the sand with seals than selfie sticks.\n\n## North Wales Gems\n\n### Porth Iago, Llyn Peninsula\n\nThe Llyn Peninsula is stuffed with incredible beaches, but Porth Iago takes the biscuit. It's a small, sheltered bay with golden sand and turquoise water. Sounds like the Med, right? Well, until the wind whips in off the Irish Sea. Still stunning though. It's accessed down a steep, narrow lane – take it slow! Parking is usually £5 in a nearby field during the summer months. This one gets popular quickly in the summer, but it's worth arriving early. Perfect for a swim, kayak, or just chilling. No facilities here, so bring your own everything.\n\n**Who it's for:** Families, couples, wild swimmers.\n\n**Who should skip it:** Those with mobility issues due to the steep access.\n\nWhile you're on the Llyn, consider tackling the [Llyn Peninsula](llyn-peninsula) coastal path for even more hidden coves. Or, head inland for a hike up Yr Eifl (The Rivals) for panoramic views.\n\n### Porth Dinllaen, Llyn Peninsula\n\nAnother beauty on the Llyn. Porth Dinllaen is more of a village with a beach attached, but it's got a unique charm. The Ty Coch Inn sits right on the beach, making it a perfect spot for a pint with a view. The beach itself is sandy and sheltered, ideal for families with young kids. You have to park in the National Trust car park in Morfa Nefyn (£6), and walk about 20 minutes along the golf course to reach the village and beach. It's flat and easy, but not ideal if you're lugging tons of gear.\n\n**Who it's for:** Families, those who like a pub on the beach, anyone after a gentle stroll.\n\n**Who should skip it:** If you want complete isolation, this isn't it.\n\n### Traeth Llyfn, Pembrokeshire\n\nOkay, not *technically* North Wales, but close enough! Traeth Llyfn is a Pembrokeshire stunner. The catch? You have to descend a rather steep metal staircase to reach it. Worth it, mind. The beach is vast and sandy, backed by dramatic cliffs. It feels remote even on busy days. The stairs are slippery when wet, so take care, especially with kids. It's a good spot for surfing (though the waves can be unpredictable), but keep an eye on the tides – you can get cut off. Parking is in a National Trust car park above the beach (£6).\n\n**Who it's for:** Adventurers, surfers, those who don't mind a bit of a climb.\n\n**Who should skip it:** Anyone with vertigo, or those who struggle with steep stairs.\n\nConsider exploring more of [Pembrokeshire's](pembrokeshire) coastline with a [coasteering](coasteering) trip with [TYF Adventure](tyf-adventure) for around £60. They operate out of St Davids. Or, for a different perspective, try sea kayaking with [Preseli Venture](preseli-venture).\n\n## South Wales Secrets\n\n### Cwmtydu, Ceredigion\n\nTucked away in a small valley, Cwmtydu is a real find. It's a shingle beach, but don't let that put you off. It's sheltered and often has calm water, perfect for a swim or paddle. In the past it was a smugglers' haunt. You might spot seals basking on the rocks. Parking is limited and can be tricky in the summer. There's a small cafe and toilets nearby.\n\n**Who it's for:** Families, kayakers, wildlife lovers.\n\n**Who should skip it:** Those who prefer golden sand.\n\n### Pwll Du Bay, Gower\n\nPwll Du Bay is accessible from either Southgate or Brandy Cove on the [Gower](gower) Peninsula, each path being about a mile long. The walk deters most people. The bay is secluded and unspoiled, with a mix of sand and pebbles. Good for swimming, but watch out for currents. There are no facilities, so bring everything you need. Parking at Southgate costs around £5, and Brandy Cove is free but limited.\n\n**Who it's for:** Those seeking tranquility, hikers, wild swimmers.\n\n**Who should skip it:** Anyone who can't manage a mile's walk.\n\nGower is a great spot for [gorge-walking](gorge-walking) with [Adventure Britain](adventure-britain), if you fancy a change from the beach.\n\n### Monknash Beach, Vale of Glamorgan\n\nA bit further east, Monknash is known for its dramatic cliffs and interesting rock formations. It's a pebbly beach, backed by a small stream. It has a wild and rugged feel. Worth noting that nudists sometimes frequent this location. Parking is in a nearby field (£3).\n\n**Who it's for:** Nature lovers, photographers, those who like a bit of solitude.\n\n**Who should skip it:** Those who want a classic sandy beach.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n*   **Tides:** Always check the tide times before you go. Some beaches disappear completely at high tide, and others can be dangerous due to strong currents.\n*   **Weather:** Welsh weather is notoriously unpredictable. Be prepared for anything, even in summer. Pack layers and waterproofs.\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of potential hazards such as slippery rocks, strong currents, and jellyfish. Never swim alone.\n*   **Leave No Trace:** Take all your rubbish home with you. Leave the beach as you found it.\n*   **Parking:** Parking can be a nightmare at popular beaches, especially during peak season. Arrive early or be prepared to walk. Some car parks are cash-only, so bring some change.\n\nSo there you have it. A few of Wales's best hidden beaches. Get out there and explore! And if you fancy something a bit different after all that relaxing, why not head to [Snowdonia](snowdonia) for some [mountain biking](mountain-biking) at Coed y Brenin (parking £2-7) or even a blast on the [Velocity 2 Zip Line](velocity-2-zip-line) at [Zip World](zip-world) for £89-109?
