  "introduction": "Snowdonia is one of the best mountain biking destinations in the UK, full stop. Within the national park and its fringes, you've got purpose-built trail centres with graded routes, gravity parks with uplift, and wild backcountry rides that take you through some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in Wales.\n\nCoed y Brenin pioneered the UK trail centre concept in the 1990s and remains excellent. But the real magic of Snowdonia MTB is the variety: you can session downhill runs at Antur Stiniog in the morning, ride flowy singletrack at Coed y Brenin in the afternoon, and tackle a wild mountain pass on the Marin Trail the next day.\n\nTrail conditions are rain-dependent (this is Snowdonia), but the best-drained trails ride well year-round. Bring mudguards. Always bring mudguards.",
