# How fit do I need to be for Kayaking in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Kayaking in Wales ranges from leisurely paddles on calm lakes to challenging sea kayaking expeditions, so the fitness level required varies greatly. For a gentle river trip with providers like Llangollen Rafting, a moderate level of fitness is sufficient. However, tackling the Pembrokeshire coast with TYF Adventure demands good upper body strength and stamina.

## Assessing Your Kayaking Fitness

Your required fitness hinges on the type of kayaking adventure you're planning. A beginner's introduction to sea kayaking in Cardigan Bay, often costing around £45-£60 for a half-day session, requires only a basic level of fitness. These sessions, often run by companies like Sea Kayaking Wales, focus on technique and safety in sheltered waters. You'll need to be comfortable sitting for a few hours and able to paddle with moderate effort.

For more advanced trips, such as multi-day expeditions along the Anglesey coastline, a higher level of fitness is essential. These trips, which can cost upwards of £500, demand considerable upper body strength, endurance, and the ability to handle challenging conditions like waves and currents. Consider your ability to perform repetitive motions for extended periods and your comfort level in potentially unstable environments.

## Practical Tips

- Check the weather forecast meticulously before you go, and be prepared for sudden changes, especially in coastal areas. Mountain weather forecasts for areas like Eryri (Snowdonia) can be particularly unpredictable.
- Book in advance, especially during peak season (May-September), as popular kayaking spots and operators get fully booked.
- Consider taking a refresher course if you haven't kayaked in a while. Many operators offer short courses to brush up on your skills.
- Wear appropriate clothing, including layers, a waterproof jacket, and sturdy footwear. Even on sunny days, the water can be cold. A personal floatation device (PFD) is mandatory and usually provided by the operator.
