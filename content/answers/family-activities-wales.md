# Best Family Adventure Activities in Wales?

Coasteering from age 8, gorge walking from age 6, and Zip World from age 7 — Wales is one of the best places in Britain for genuine family adventure, not watered-down theme park stuff.

## Why Wales Works for Families

Most Welsh adventure operators are small, owner-run businesses who actually care about giving your kids a brilliant time. Group sizes are small (typically 6–12), guides are experienced with children, and the activities are real — your kids aren't on a simulator, they're jumping off actual cliffs into actual sea.

The price point helps too. A family coasteering session in Wales costs less than a day at most English theme parks, and your kids will remember it for years rather than hours.

## Best Activities by Age

### Ages 4–7: Little Adventurers

**Forest adventure and nature trails** — Coed y Brenin in [Snowdonia](/snowdonia) has brilliant family trails with sculptures and activities built in. Free entry, pay for parking.

**Beach adventures** — Bodyboarding at Newgale in [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire) is perfect for young kids. Gentle waves, wide sand, and rock pools at low tide. Boards hire for about £5.

**Pony trekking** — Short rides suitable for young children, with many stables offering lead-rein sessions from about £25 for 30 minutes.

**Bounce Below** — Underground trampolines in a slate cavern. Kids absolutely love it. From £25 per person, and suitable from age 7 (under 7s have dedicated sessions at some sites).

### Ages 7–12: Proper Adventures

**Coasteering** — Most operators take children from age 8 (some from 7). Family-specific sessions are available with adjusted cliff jump heights and calmer swimming sections. Typically £40–£55 for under-16s in [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire). See our [coasteering guide](/activities/coasteering).

**Gorge walking** — From age 6 with some operators. Wading through rivers, scrambling up small waterfalls, and sliding down natural water chutes. Kids think it's the best thing ever. Around £35–£50 for juniors in the [Brecon Beacons](/brecon-beacons).

**Zip World** — Several experiences suitable from age 7. Fforest Coaster, Treetop Nets, and Zip World Titan all work well for families. Velocity 2 (the big one) is from age 10. Prices from £20–£60 per person depending on the experience.

**Kayaking and SUP** — Sheltered bays on the [Llŷn Peninsula](/llyn-peninsula) and [Anglesey](/anglesey) are ideal for family paddle sessions. Guided trips from about £30–£45 per child.

### Ages 12+: Full Send

At 12+, most adult activities become available. Teenagers can do full coasteering sessions, caving trips, mountain scrambles, and surf lessons alongside adults. This is where Wales really shines — there's nothing quite like watching your teenager jump off a 20-foot cliff for the first time.
