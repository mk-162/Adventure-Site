# What Can I Do in Wales When It Rains?

## Quick Answer

Wales gets a lot of rain — **embrace it**. Some of the best adventures happen underground (Zip World Bounce Below, Go Below caving), indoors (climbing walls, escape rooms), or in the water anyway (gorge walking — you're getting wet regardless). Add world-class castles, excellent museums, and cosy pubs, and rainy days become opportunities rather than problems.

## Best Rainy Day Adventures

### Underground Adventures

#### Zip World Bounce Below & Caverns (Blaenau Ffestiniog)
The ultimate rainy day activity — **bounce on trampolines in a Victorian slate cavern** twice the size of St Paul's Cathedral.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Price** | Bounce Below: £30/person, Caverns: £80/person |
| **Duration** | Bounce Below: 1 hour, Caverns: 2 hours |
| **Min Age** | Bounce Below: 7+, Caverns: 10+ |
| **Booking** | Essential — book at zipworld.co.uk |

**Why it works:** Completely underground, utterly unique. Rain literally cannot touch you.

#### Go Below Underground Adventures (Blaenau Ffestiniog)
Explore abandoned slate mines with zip lines, boat rides, and waterfall traverses — all underground.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Price** | From £89/person (Ultimate Xtreme) |
| **Duration** | 4-7 hours depending on package |
| **Min Age** | 10+ (Ultimate), 18+ (Xtreme) |
| **Booking** | Essential |

**Why it works:** The deeper underground, the more dramatic. Rain on the surface is irrelevant.

#### Electric Mountain (Llanberis)
Tour the inside of Dinorwig Power Station — a cathedral-sized cavern housing Europe's fastest hydroelectric power station.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Price** | £10-15/person |
| **Duration** | 1.5 hours |
| **Min Age** | 4+ |
| **Booking** | Recommended |

**Why it works:** Fascinating engineering inside a mountain. Kids love the scale.

### Wet Adventures (Rain Doesn't Matter)

#### Gorge Walking
You're in a river, in a wetsuit, climbing waterfalls — **rain makes it better**. Higher water levels = more dramatic waterfalls.

- **Brecon Beacons operators:** £50-75/person
- **Runs in almost all weather** (except flood conditions)

#### Caving
Underground, temperature-stable, and rain-proof. Wales has excellent caving options:

**Dan yr Ogof (Brecon Beacons):**
- Self-guided showcaves: £18/adult
- Adventure caving: £45-70/person

**Adventure caving operators:**
- Black Mountain Activities: £45-60/person
- Adventures Wales: £50-75/person

#### Wild Swimming
Already wet? Sea temperature doesn't change in rain. Lakes and rivers swell beautifully. Many wild swimmers prefer grey days — fewer crowds, dramatic atmosphere.

## The Mindset Shift

**Rain in Wales is normal.** Average annual rainfall in Snowdonia is **3,000mm** (London gets 600mm). If you only do activities in dry weather, you'll miss half your trip.

### Embrace Wet Adventures
- Gorge walking and caving **improve** in rain
- Coasteering happens regardless (you're in the sea)
- Wild swimming is beautiful in the rain
- Waterfalls are most dramatic after rain

### Layer Up
Proper waterproofs make walking in rain enjoyable rather than miserable:
- Waterproof jacket (breathable)
- Waterproof trousers
- Good boots
- Dry change of clothes in the car

### Have a Backup Plan
Check weather forecasts but don't cancel activities unless conditions are genuinely dangerous. Most outdoor operators run in light-moderate rain.
