  "introduction": "For generations, Snowdonia has been the heart of Welsh climbing. It's not just the stunning scenery – though Tryfan's silhouette against the dawn is enough to stop you in your tracks. It's the sheer variety of rock, the depth of history etched into every crag, and the vibrant climbing community that makes this place so special.\n\nFrom the approachable Idwal Slabs – perfect for beginners and those honing their skills – to the intimidating north face of Clogwyn Du'r Arddu (Cloggy), which demands respect and experience, Snowdonia offers something for every climber. You'll find everything from single-pitch sport routes at Tremadoc to multi-pitch traditional climbs on Dinas Cromlech.\n\nWhat sets Snowdonia apart is its ever-changing character. A sunny day on the coast can quickly turn into a blustery gale in the mountains, testing your skills and adaptability. Navigation can be tricky, and route finding even on well-trodden climbs requires attention. It’s not always easy, but that’s what makes the summit so rewarding.\n\nSnowdonia is best suited for climbers who appreciate a bit of grit, a touch of history, and a good pint at the end of the day. Whether you're a seasoned alpinist or just starting your climbing journey, you'll find your place here, and you'll undoubtedly be back for more. Remember, respect the mountains, know your limits, and enjoy the adventure! Climbing in Snowdonia is an experience you won't forget.",
