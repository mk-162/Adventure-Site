Here's a rundown of the Wales Adventure Awards for 2025, celebrating the folks who make it happen.\n\n# Wales Adventure Awards 2025: Who Won What\n\nAlright, listen up, you lot. Forget those fluffy travel blogs – this is the real deal. We’re talking about the Wales Adventure Awards, celebrating the blokes and blokesses who make our little corner of the world such a brilliant place to get properly stuck in. No sponsorships here, just my honest take based on years of scrambling up mountains, paddling through white water, and generally making a right fool of myself outdoors.\n\n## Snowdonia Reigns Supreme (Again)\n\nLet's be honest, it’s hardly a surprise, is it? Snowdonia always cleans up. This year’s no different, and deservedly so.\n\n### Best Thrill: Zip World (For Obvious Reasons)\n\nLook, if you haven't heard of Zip World by now, where have you been? Under a rock? They bagged the \"Best Thrill\" award again, and why not? Their Velocity 2 Zip Line is still the fastest in the world, and hurtling headfirst over Penrhyn Quarry for £89-£109 is an experience you won't forget in a hurry. If you’re after something a bit tamer, the Zip World Fforest Coaster at Betws-y-Coed is a cracking alternative, especially if you've got the kids in tow (£25-£35). For something different, and strangely terrifying, give Bounce Below a go. Trampolines in a cavern? Mental, but brilliant for £25-£35.\n\n### Best Guiding: MountainXperience\n\nFor serious mountain adventures, you can't go wrong with MountainXperience. They picked up \"Best Guiding\" for their work on routes like Crib Goch. That’s a serious scramble, not for the faint of heart, but with these guys you’re in safe hands (price around £55-£75). If you're looking to tackle Snowdon but want to skip the crowds on the Llanberis Path, they also offer guided walks up less-trodden routes (£45-£65).\n\n### Best Family Adventure: Coed y Brenin (and Antur Stiniog sneaking in)\n\nMountain biking at Coed y Brenin Forest Park is a must. \"Best Family Adventure\" is well-deserved. Park up for £2-7 and spend the day on the MinorTaur trail, a cracking introduction to mountain biking for the whole family. For the more experienced, the Temtiwr trail will sort you out, but it’s rated difficult.\n\nNow, a cheeky shout-out here to Antur Stiniog. While not strictly \"family\", their uplift service makes downhill mountain biking accessible for a wider range of abilities. Plenty of folk bring their (capable) kids, and the prices are reasonable at £35-£45 for the uplift.\n\n## Pembrokeshire: Coastal Kings and Queens\n\nSnowdonia might steal the headlines, but Pembrokeshire’s got the coast nailed.\n\n### Best Coastal Experience: TYF Adventure\n\nNo surprises here. TYF Adventure snagged \"Best Coastal Experience\" for their coasteering. Based in St Davids, they’ve been showing people the ropes (literally, sometimes) for years. Their \"Coasteering Classic\" is a solid option for all levels at around £60. They provide all the gear, you just need to bring your sense of adventure (and maybe a bit of courage!). While you're down that way, consider booking in for a sea kayaking tour with them too. You can explore the coastline from a totally different perspective.\n\n### Wild Card: Preseli Venture\n\nWhile TYF are the big name, I'd also urge you to check out Preseli Venture. They offer coasteering too, but also do some brilliant kayaking trips and even some wild swimming excursions. They're a bit smaller, but they've got a proper passion for what they do and offer a really personal experience.\n\n## Brecon Beacons: Up-and-Coming\n\nThe Brecon Beacons are starting to give Snowdonia a run for their money. While they didn't win any awards this year, keep an eye on Adventure Britain based around Gower and the Beacons. They offer canyoning, caving, gorge walking, and more, and they’re a solid choice if you're in the area.\n\nBikePark Wales is still the go-to for serious mountain bikers in South Wales. They didn't quite clinch an award this year, but they're always pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\n\n## What This Means For You\n\nRight, so what does all this award stuff mean for you, the person actually planning a trip? Simple. It's a good starting point. These operators are consistently delivering quality experiences, so you're less likely to end up with a cowboy outfit.\n\n### Don't Just Take My Word For It\n\nDo your research. Read reviews. Think about what you actually *want* to do. Wales has got something for everyone, from gentle strolls along the coastal path (especially beautiful in Anglesey) to scaling the most challenging peaks.\n\n### Book Ahead (Seriously)\n\nEspecially during peak season (school holidays, summer months), you need to book these activities well in advance. The award winners are popular for a reason, and they fill up fast.\n\n### Consider the Season\n\nWales is beautiful year-round, but the weather can be brutal. Summer offers the best chance of sunshine, but it's also the busiest. Spring and autumn can be stunning, with fewer crowds, but be prepared for rain. Winter is for the hardy – bring your thermals!\n\n### Beyond the Awards\n\nRemember, these awards are just a snapshot. There are loads of other brilliant operators out there doing great things. Explore, get off the beaten track, and find your own adventure in Wales. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off for a pint. Sláinte!",
