# What Are the Best Wild Swimming Tips for Beginners?

## Quick Answer

Start in sheltered, calm water with other people around. Never swim alone. Acclimatise gradually — don't just jump in. A wetsuit extends your season and comfort massively. Check water quality, tell someone your plans, and bring warm clothes for afterwards (you'll need them more than you think).

## Getting Started Safely

Wild swimming in Wales is incredible, but the water is genuinely cold — colder than most people expect. Even in August, mountain lakes sit around 12-15°C and the sea rarely tops 16°C. That's the reality. Here's how to enjoy it safely:

### Acclimatise Properly

*   **Wade in slowly.** Splash water on your face, neck, and wrists before submerging. This helps your body adjust and reduces cold water shock.
*   **Control your breathing.** The first 30-60 seconds are the worst. Cold water triggers a gasp reflex — breathe slowly and deliberately through it.
*   **Start with short dips.** 5-10 minutes is plenty for your first few swims. Build up gradually over weeks. The "after-drop" (continued cooling after you exit) catches out beginners — get out while you still feel OK.
*   **Swim regularly.** Your body adapts to cold water over time. Once-a-week swims through the season build genuine tolerance.

### Essential Gear

*   **Wetsuit:** Even a shorty wetsuit transforms the experience. For mountain lakes and sea swimming from spring to autumn, a 3-4mm full suit is ideal. You can hire them from surf shops and outdoor centres across Wales for around £10-15/day.
*   **Tow float:** A brightly coloured inflatable float that clips around your waist. Increases your visibility to boats and other water users, and gives you something to rest on if you get tired. Around £20-30 to buy. Non-negotiable for sea swimming.
*   **Neoprene swim cap:** You lose a huge amount of heat through your head. A neoprene cap (not just a silicone one) makes a massive difference in cold water.
*   **Warm clothes for after:** This is where most beginners go wrong. You need a warm hat, thick fleece, and dry layers ready the moment you get out. A changing robe/dryrobe is a worthwhile investment if you swim regularly.
*   **Water shoes:** Many Welsh swim spots have rocky entries. Neoprene shoes protect your feet and improve grip.

## Best Beginner Spots in Wales

| Spot | Type | Why It's Good for Beginners | Location |
|------|------|---------------------------|----------|
| Llyn Padarn | Lake | Easy access, gently shelving, mountain views | Llanberis, Snowdonia |
| Barafundle Bay | Sea | Sheltered bay, sandy bottom, stunning | Pembrokeshire |
| River Usk near Crickhowell | River | Gentle current, gravel beaches, relatively warm | Brecon Beacons |
| Aberporth Beach | Sea | Sheltered, sandy, lifeguarded in summer | Ceredigion |
| Blue Lagoon, Abereiddy | Quarry | Dramatic setting, deep water, clear visibility | Pembrokeshire |

**Llyn Padarn** near Llanberis is probably the best first wild swim in Wales. Easy access, gently shelving shoreline, and Snowdon as a backdrop. It's popular with open water swimming groups, so you'll often find company. The water's cold (it's a mountain lake) but manageable with a wetsuit.

**Barafundle Bay** in Pembrokeshire is gorgeous — clear turquoise water in a sheltered bay with golden sand. The short walk from the car park keeps it from getting too crowded. [Find wild swimming in Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/wild-swimming).

## Safety Essentials

*   **Never swim alone.** This is the single most important rule. Swim with a buddy or join a local group — the Welsh outdoor swimming community is friendly and welcoming.
*   **Check water quality.** Natural Resources Wales publishes bathing water reports. After heavy rain, water quality can drop significantly — give it 48 hours before swimming in rivers or sea near river mouths.
*   **Tell someone your plans.** Where you're going, when you'll be back. Many wild swimming spots have limited or zero phone signal.
*   **Know your limits.** Cold water saps energy faster than pool swimming. Swim parallel to shore, not out to sea. Stay within your depth.
*   **Watch for currents.** Rivers can have surprisingly strong currents, even when they look calm. Sea swimming near headlands means tidal currents. If in doubt, don't.
*   **Be aware of Weil's disease (Leptospirosis).** Cover cuts with waterproof plasters. Don't swallow river water. The risk is low but real.

## The Smart Choice

Your first wild swim should be in a sheltered spot, with other people around, on a calm day. Bring a wetsuit, a tow float, and more warm clothes than you think you'll need. Start with a short dip — even 5 minutes counts. The buzz afterwards is genuine and addictive. If you want a guided introduction, operators like Celtic Quest Coasteering in Pembrokeshire run guided wild swimming sessions that take the stress out of finding safe spots.
