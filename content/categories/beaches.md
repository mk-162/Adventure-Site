# Beaches in Wales

Wales has over 200 beaches along 870 miles of coastline, and some of them genuinely rival anything in the Mediterranean — minus the temperature, obviously. From the sweeping golden curve of Rhossili Bay (regularly voted one of Britain's best beaches) to hidden Pembrokeshire coves accessible only by foot, the Welsh coast delivers.

Two things make Welsh beaches special: they're never far away (no part of Wales is more than 50 miles from the sea) and they're rarely crowded by European standards, even in peak summer.

## The Best Beaches by Region

### Gower Peninsula (Best for Variety)
The Gower was Britain's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and it earned the title largely on the strength of its beaches:

- **Rhossili Bay** — Three miles of golden sand backed by dramatic cliffs. Regularly in "best beaches in Britain" lists. Great for surfing at the north end (Llangennith), spectacular walking at the south. Worm's Head is accessible at low tide.
- **Three Cliffs Bay** — Arguably the most photographed beach in Wales. Three dramatic limestone pinnacles frame a sandy bay. Access requires a 15-minute walk, which keeps it quieter.
- **Oxwich Bay** — Spacious sandy beach with dunes behind. More facilities than some Gower beaches — café, toilets, good parking. Popular with families.
- **Caswell Bay** — Compact, family-friendly, easy parking. Gets busy at high tide when the sand shrinks. Good rock pools.
- **Mewslade Bay** — Hidden gem. Requires a walk from Pitton. Dramatic cliffs, wild feel, never crowded.

### Pembrokeshire (Best for Coast Path Access)
Over 50 beaches, many of them Blue Flag standard:

- **Barafundle Bay** — Often called the best beach in Wales. Short walk from the car park at Stackpole Quay. No facilities, no access road — just perfect sand and turquoise water in a sheltered cove.
- **Freshwater West** — Wild, exposed, surfing beach. Featured in Harry Potter (Shell Cottage). Strong currents — not for casual swimmers.
- **Whitesands (Traeth Mawr)** — Near St David's. Popular surfing beach with lifeguards in summer. Good café.
- **Broad Haven South** — Beautiful National Trust beach near Stackpole. Family-friendly with rock pools.
- **Tenby beaches** — Castle Beach, North Beach and South Beach. Classic seaside town beaches with facilities, harbour views and colourful Georgian houses as a backdrop.

### Anglesey (Best for Remoteness)
- **Newborough/Llanddwyn** — Vast sandy beach with views to Snowdonia. Llanddwyn Island at one end (accessible at low tide) is magical.
- **Trearddur Bay** — Sheltered, family-friendly, good facilities.
- **Rhosneigr** — Popular with kitesurfers and windsurfers.

### Llŷn Peninsula (Best for Adventure)
- **Porth Oer (Whistling Sands)** — The sand literally squeaks when you walk on it. Unique and beautiful.
- **Abersoch** — Popular sailing and watersports hub with several beaches.

### North Wales Coast
- **Llandudno** — Classic Victorian seaside. Two beaches (North Shore and West Shore) plus Great Orme headland.

## Practical Tips

- **Tides**: Welsh beaches change dramatically between tides. Some (Three Cliffs, Caswell) almost disappear at high water. Others (Rhossili, Newborough) are enormous at low tide. Check tide times before you go.
- **Parking**: Most popular beaches charge £3–8 for parking in summer. National Trust beaches are free for members. Arrive early at popular spots (before 10am in July/August).
- **Lifeguards**: RNLI lifeguards patrol many popular beaches May–September. Swim between the red and yellow flags.
- **Water temperature**: 10–16°C typically. July and August are warmest. A wetsuit makes a huge difference if you want to spend more than 10 minutes in the water.
- **Dogs**: Many beaches restrict dogs during summer months (typically May–September). Check local signs. Off-season, dogs are welcome almost everywhere.
- **Facilities**: Range from none (Barafundle, Mewslade) to full amenities (Tenby, Oxwich). Pack what you need.

## Best Time to Visit

- **Late spring (May–June)**: Warming up, beaches relatively quiet, wildflowers on the cliffs. Water still cold.
- **Summer (July–August)**: Warmest water and air. Busiest. Arrive early for parking at popular spots.
- **September**: Arguably the sweet spot. Often warm, less crowded, sea at its warmest after a summer of heating up. Lifeguards still present at many beaches.
- **Autumn/Winter**: Quiet, dramatic, beautiful on clear days. The Gower and Pembrokeshire coastal walks are stunning. Wrap up and bring a thermos.

## Who It's For

Everyone. That's the honest answer. Welsh beaches range from gentle sandy bays perfect for toddlers (Oxwich, Caswell, Trearddur) to wild surf beaches for experienced water users (Freshwater West, Llangennith) to remote coves for those who just want to be left alone with a book and the sound of waves.
