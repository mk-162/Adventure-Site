# Where are the best Climbing locations in Wales?

## Quick Answer

Wales boasts world-class climbing, from the rugged sea cliffs of Pembroke to the towering peaks of Eryri (Snowdonia). For trad climbing, Pembroke is unmatched, while Eryri offers everything from scrambling to multi-pitch routes. Indoor climbers can find excellent facilities in most major towns, like the Climbing Hangar in Swansea.

## Coastal Climbing in Pembrokeshire

Pembrokeshire's coastline is a climber's paradise, offering stunning views and a variety of routes on mostly limestone cliffs. Popular spots include Stackpole Head, known for its challenging sea cliff climbs, and Bosherston Head, which has a mix of easier and more difficult routes. Climbs here range from single-pitch sport routes to multi-pitch trad climbs, with grades to suit all abilities. Expect to pay around £200-£300 for a guided day of climbing with a local operator like TYF Adventure in St Davids, including equipment hire.

The climbing season in Pembrokeshire is generally best from spring to autumn, as winter can bring wet and windy conditions. Be aware of tidal conditions, as some routes are only accessible at low tide. Also, be mindful of nesting birds, as certain areas may have seasonal restrictions.

## Mountain Climbing in Eryri (Snowdonia)

Eryri offers a completely different climbing experience, with its towering mountains and varied rock types. Tryfan is a classic scramble, while harder climbs can be found on the imposing cliffs of Clogwyn Du'r Arddu ("Cloggy") and the Llanberis Pass. For those new to mountain climbing, consider hiring a guide from a local company such as Mountain Magic, with prices starting around £250 per day for a private guide.

Eryri is a year-round climbing destination, but conditions can be unpredictable, especially in winter. Snow and ice can transform routes, requiring specialized equipment and experience. Always check the weather forecast before heading out and be prepared for changing conditions.

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Pembroke Sea Cliffs | Trad Climbing, Stunning Views | Beginner to Advanced | Pembrokeshire Coast |
| Tryfan | Scrambling, Mountain Experience | Moderate | Eryri (Snowdonia) |
| Clogwyn Du'r Arddu | Hard Multi-Pitch Routes | Advanced | Eryri (Snowdonia) |

## Practical Tips

- Check the BMC (British Mountaineering Council) website for access restrictions and crag closures, especially during nesting season.
- For Pembrokeshire sea cliffs, always check the tide times – some routes become unclimbable or even dangerous at high tide.
- Parking in popular climbing areas like the Llanberis Pass can be limited, especially on weekends. Arrive early or consider using public transport.
- When climbing in Eryri, be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions. Pack extra layers, a waterproof jacket, and a map and compass.
