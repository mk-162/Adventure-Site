# Is Wild Camping Legal in Wales?

## Quick Answer

**No, wild camping is not legal in Wales without landowner permission.** Unlike Scotland (which has legal wild camping rights under the Land Reform Act), Wales follows English law where camping on someone else's land without consent is civil trespass. However, **informal bivvying** on remote open land is widely tolerated if done responsibly — arriving late, leaving early, and leaving no trace. Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park explicitly states wild camping is not permitted without landowner permission.

## The Legal Position

Under the **Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW Act)**, you have the right to walk across designated "open access land" in Wales — but this explicitly **excludes camping**. The CROW Act specifically prohibits:

- Pitching a tent, tarp, hammock, or bivvy bag
- Camping within 100 metres of roads
- Camping in enclosures (fenced land)
- Staying more than two nights in one spot

**Trespass in England and Wales is civil, not criminal** — meaning you can't be arrested for simply camping without permission. However, the landowner (or their agent) can ask you to leave, and if you refuse, they can involve police under aggravated trespass laws.

### The Dartmoor Ruling (2025)

The May 2025 Supreme Court decision upheld wild camping rights on **Dartmoor National Park in England** — but this applies only to Dartmoor's specific historical byelaws. It has **no direct legal effect on Wales**, which remains under the stricter CROW Act rules.

The British Mountaineering Council (BMC) is campaigning to extend wild camping rights to Wales and other national parks, but as of 2025, no legal changes have been made.

## Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park Rules

The official position from **Eryri National Park Authority** is clear:

> "Wild camping is not permitted anywhere in Eryri without prior permission from the landowner or farmer."

**You cannot get permission from the Park Authority** — they don't own the land. Most of Eryri is privately owned by farmers, forestry companies, or estates. Camping is also prohibited in:

- Car parks and laybys
- Roadside verges  
- Forests and woodland
- Riversides
- Coastal areas

To camp legally, you must **contact the landowner directly** — often the farmer whose land you want to use. This is rarely practical for most visitors.

## The Reality: Tolerated Wild Camping

Despite the legal position, **informal wild camping does happen** across Wales — and in many remote areas, it's tolerated provided you follow the unwritten code:

### The Unwritten Rules

1. **Pitch late (after 7pm), leave early (before 8am)** — minimise your visible presence
2. **Camp high and remote** — mountain summits, ridge lines, away from habitation
3. **Leave no trace** — pack out everything, no fires, no toilet paper left behind
4. **Keep groups small** — 1-2 tents maximum
5. **Avoid farmland** — sheep grazing land, enclosed fields, near buildings
6. **Move on if asked** — respect landowners, farmers, and wardens
7. **No fires** — ever. Welsh hills are often dry grass and peat

### Where Tolerated Wild Camping Works

**Higher ground in Snowdonia** (above 500m):
- Carneddau ridgeline  
- Glyderau high camps
- Remote spots on the Rhinogs
- Away from the busy Snowdon paths

**Brecon Beacons high points:**
- Pen y Fan summit plateau
- The Black Mountains ridges
- Fforest Fawr remote areas

**Pembrokeshire Coast Path** — very difficult due to being mostly private farmland. Not recommended.

### Where It Doesn't Work

- **Anywhere visible from roads or villages**
- **Popular honeypot areas** (Llyn Idwal, Cwm Idwal, Pen-y-Pass)
- **Enclosed farmland with livestock**
- **Nature reserves** (SSSIs have additional protections)
- **National Trust car parks** (they will ask you to leave)

## Better Alternatives

### Wild Camping Areas (with permission)

Some estates and farms explicitly welcome wild campers for a small fee:

- **Graig Wen (Dolgellau area)** — wild camping permitted on designated spots
- **Various farm agreements** — contact local farmers directly via the Farmers' Union of Wales

### Lightweight Campsites

Basic, remote campsites that feel wild but are legal:

- **Llyn Gwynant Campsite** — lakeside in Snowdonia, £12-15/night
- **Cae Du Campsite** — near Abersoch, basic facilities, £10-14/night  
- **YHA Camping Barns** — very basic, dry shelter, from £8/night
- **National Trust Campsite (Dolgellau)** — basic, scenic, £8-12/night

### Bothies

Free mountain shelters (first come, first served):

- **Dulyn Bothy** — Carneddau, very basic
- **Several MBA bothies** — check Mountain Bothies Association listings

## The Responsible Approach

If you choose to wild camp in Wales:

1. **Assume it's not allowed** — you're relying on tolerance, not rights
2. **Be prepared to move** — have a backup plan if asked to leave
3. **Follow Leave No Trace strictly** — the future of informal wild camping depends on behaviour
4. **Consider the season** — lambing (March-May) is particularly sensitive
5. **Check weather** — Welsh mountains get serious weather; wild camping in bad conditions is dangerous

### The Eryri Wild Camping Code

If you do wild camp with permission:

- Camp discreetly in hills/mountains
- Limit to 1-2 nights maximum
- Pack out all rubbish  
- Minimise environmental impact
- Respect wildlife
- Use existing stoves (no open fires)

## The Future

The BMC's 2025 campaign seeks legal wild camping rights in England and Wales, similar to Scotland. A survey showed:

- **84%** support a legal right to wild camp
- **90%** support broader rights to roam

But as of 2025, the law hasn't changed. Campaigners hope the Dartmoor precedent will encourage reviews in Wales, but Eryri and other parks remain under stricter rules.

## The Smart Choice

**Want legal wild-ish camping?** Book a basic campsite in a scenic location — Llyn Gwynant or the Snowdonia edge sites give you the experience without the legal grey area.

**Experienced and prepared to be discreet?** High-level informal camping is tolerated but not legal. Behave impeccably, leave no trace, and accept you're operating in a grey area.

**Groups, families, or new to camping?** Stick to proper campsites. The stress of potentially being asked to move isn't worth it.
