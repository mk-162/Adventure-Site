# How many days should I spend in Snowdonia?

## Quick Answer

To truly experience Snowdonia (Eryri), aim for at least three full days. This allows you to summit Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) via a challenging route like the Watkin Path, explore the slate quarries of Blaenau Ffestiniog with Zip World, and discover hidden gems like the Sygun Copper Mine. For a more relaxed pace, or if you're planning activities like rock climbing or mountain biking, consider five days or more.

## Crafting Your Snowdonia Itinerary

A shorter trip of 2-3 days is ideal for ticking off the main highlights. Base yourself in Llanberis for easy access to the Snowdon Mountain Railway (£35 return) or Pen y Pass for popular walking routes. Day one could be dedicated to conquering Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), followed by a well-deserved pub meal at the Heights Hotel in Llanberis. On day two, head to Betws-y-Coed, explore the Swallow Falls (£2.00 entry), and maybe squeeze in a gorge walking adventure with a local operator like TYF Adventure (from £75).

For a longer 5-7 day trip, you can delve deeper. Explore the quieter side of Eryri, like the Nantlle Ridge, or head to the coast for coasteering at Anglesey with a company like Coastal Adventures (from £60). Consider a day trip to Portmeirion, the quirky Italianate village (entry £18), or spend a day mountain biking at Coed y Brenin Forest Park, near Dolgellau (bike hire from £30 per day). This allows for more flexibility and the chance to experience a wider range of activities.
