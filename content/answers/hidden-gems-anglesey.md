# What are the hidden gems and secret spots in Anglesey?

## Quick Answer

Anglesey, or Ynys Môn, is full of secluded beauty beyond the popular spots. Discover the dramatic cliffs and hidden coves of the GeoMôn UNESCO Global Geopark, explore the lesser-known trails around South Stack, or kayak to Church Island for a unique perspective of St. Tysilio's Church. For a truly off-the-beaten-path experience, seek out the ancient standing stones scattered across the island.

## Discovering Anglesey's Secret Coastline

Forget the crowded beaches of Trearddur Bay; Anglesey's real charm lies in its hidden coastal gems. Head to Porth Padrig, also known as Church Bay, on the north coast. Here, you can explore the unique rock formations and enjoy a quiet afternoon away from the crowds. The nearby Church Bay Inn offers hearty meals and local ales. Alternatively, venture to the eastern side of the island and discover the secluded bay of Traeth yr Ora, a perfect spot for a peaceful swim or a picnic. Be aware that access to some of these smaller beaches can be via narrow, winding roads and require a short walk.

For a more adventurous experience, consider coasteering with providers like Anglesey Adventures based in Holyhead. They offer guided tours along the rugged coastline, allowing you to explore hidden caves and jump into crystal-clear waters. Prices typically range from £50-£75 per person. Kayaking is also a fantastic way to discover hidden coves. Several local companies offer guided tours, launching from Beaumaris or Menai Bridge. Expect to pay around £40-£60 for a half-day trip.

## Inland Secrets and Ancient History

Beyond the coastline, Anglesey hides many inland treasures. Explore the Llyn Alaw reservoir, a haven for birdwatchers and a peaceful spot for a walk. The surrounding area is also dotted with ancient standing stones and burial chambers, remnants of the island's rich history. One particularly interesting site is Bryn Celli Ddu, a Neolithic passage tomb that offers a glimpse into Anglesey's prehistoric past. Entrance is free, but check opening times as it can be closed during certain times of the year for preservation.

For a unique perspective on Anglesey's history, visit the Halen Môn sea salt factory near Brynsiencyn. Take a tour to learn about the traditional methods used to harvest sea salt from the Menai Strait, and sample the award-winning product. Tours cost around £15 per person. And don't miss Plas Newydd House and Gardens, a National Trust property with stunning views of the Menai Strait and Snowdonia.

## Practical Tips

- Always check tide times before exploring coastal areas, especially if you plan to visit caves or secluded beaches. Some areas can become inaccessible at high tide.
- Many of the smaller roads on Anglesey are narrow and winding, so drive with caution and be prepared to pull over to allow other vehicles to pass.
- Book tours and activities in advance, especially during peak season (summer months and school holidays), to avoid disappointment.
- Pack appropriate clothing and footwear for outdoor activities. The weather on Anglesey can be unpredictable, so be prepared for rain and wind, even on sunny days.
