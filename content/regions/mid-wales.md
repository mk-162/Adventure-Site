# About Mid Wales

Mid Wales: think rugged hills rolling down to the coast, secret valleys carved by rushing rivers, and a sense of being properly *away* from it all. This isn't about manicured trails or crowded hotspots. It's a place to test yourself, find your own path, and connect with the raw energy of the Welsh landscape.

From the peaks of Plynlimon to the wave-battered beaches of Cardigan Bay, Mid Wales throws down the gauntlet. Whether you're chasing adrenaline or seeking solitude, you'll find it here, etched into every mile of trail, every crashing wave, every windswept ridge.

## Best For

- Mountain Biking: World-class trails at Coed y Brenin and Llandegla Oneplanet.
- Watersports: Surf the waves at Borth or paddleboard on a tranquil lake.
- Trail Running: Endless routes through forests, hills, and along the coast.

## Best Time to Visit

Spring (April-May) and Autumn (September-October) offer the sweet spot: fewer crowds, vibrant colours, and generally milder weather. Summer (June-August) is peak season, bringing warmer temperatures but also more visitors, especially to coastal areas. Be prepared for changeable conditions year-round – pack layers!

Winter (November-March) can be harsh, with potential for snow and closures, especially at higher elevations. That said, if you're properly equipped and experienced, the stark beauty of a Mid Wales winter can be truly unforgettable.

## Getting There

The nearest airports are Birmingham (BHX) and Cardiff (CWL), both around 2-3 hours drive. Major train stations include Aberystwyth, Machynlleth, and Newtown, with connections to Shrewsbury and the wider UK rail network. Driving times: London (4-5 hours), Manchester (2.5-3.5 hours), Birmingham (2-3 hours).

## Pro Tips

- Check trail conditions: Before hitting the mountain bike trails, check with Coed y Brenin or Llandegla for closures or maintenance.
- Wild swimming spots: Skip the crowded beaches and find a secluded river pool for a refreshing dip. Just be mindful of currents and water temperature.
- Support local businesses: Ditch the supermarket and stock up on supplies at local farm shops and markets. You'll taste the difference, and support the community.
