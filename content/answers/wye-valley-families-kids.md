# Is Wye Valley good for families with children?

## Quick Answer

Absolutely! The Wye Valley is fantastic for families, offering a blend of gentle outdoor adventures and historical exploration. From canoeing on the River Wye to exploring kid-friendly castles like Chepstow Castle, there's something for every age group. Just be mindful of the terrain if hiking with very young children.

## Family-Friendly Activities in the Wye Valley

The Wye Valley offers a range of activities perfect for families. For a gentle introduction to the area, consider a canoe trip with Wye Valley Canoes from Symonds Yat. They offer various routes suitable for beginners, including shorter loops ideal for younger children. Expect to pay around £45 for a family canoe hire for a half-day. Alternatively, explore Puzzlewood, a unique ancient woodland near Coleford, Gloucestershire, filled with winding paths and intriguing rock formations; entry is around £8 per child and £9.50 per adult.

For families seeking a bit more adventure, there are numerous walking trails. The Offa's Dyke Path offers sections suitable for shorter walks with children, particularly around Tintern Abbey, where you can combine a historic visit with a riverside stroll. Remember that some parts of the trail can be uneven, so sturdy footwear is recommended. For a less strenuous option, try the sculpture trail at Beechenhurst in the Forest of Dean, which is easily accessible and features impressive wooden sculptures that kids will love.

## Accommodation and Dining Considerations

Finding the right base is crucial for a successful family trip. The Wye Valley has a good selection of family-friendly accommodations, from campsites like the Forest of Dean Camping to charming B&Bs in villages like Tintern. Self-catering cottages are also a popular option, offering more space and flexibility for families. Expect to pay between £80-£150 per night for a family-sized cottage, depending on the season.

When it comes to dining, many pubs and cafes in the Wye Valley cater to families. The Saracen's Head Inn at Symonds Yat East offers a children's menu and stunning views of the river. Many establishments also provide outdoor seating, allowing children to run around while parents relax. Pack snacks and drinks, especially if you plan on hiking or canoeing, as options can be limited in some remote areas.
