# What are the best Gorge Walking tips for beginners?

## Quick Answer

Gorge walking, also known as canyoning or gorge scrambling, is an exhilarating way to experience the Welsh outdoors. For beginners, focus on choosing a reputable operator like TYF Adventure in Pembrokeshire or Zip World in Eryri (Snowdonia), and be honest about your fitness level when booking. Always listen carefully to your guide's safety briefing, and don't be afraid to ask questions – they know the gorge inside and out!

## Choosing the Right Gorge and Operator

Not all gorges are created equal, and neither are the operators who run the trips. For a first-timer, look for a gorge walking experience that's graded as "easy" or "beginner-friendly." TYF Adventure, based near St Davids, Pembrokeshire, offers introductory gorge walking sessions in the Afon Mellte, Brecon Beacons, perfect for families and those new to the sport. Expect to pay around £50-£75 per person for a half-day session. In North Wales, Zip World's gorge walking adventures near Betws-y-Coed also cater to beginners, but be prepared for potentially colder water temperatures, especially outside of July and August.

When selecting an operator, prioritize those with experienced and qualified guides. Check reviews and ensure they provide all necessary equipment, including wetsuits, helmets, and buoyancy aids. Don't be afraid to ask about the guide-to-participant ratio; a smaller group size often means more personalized attention and a safer experience. Be aware that some gorges are more exposed than others; if you're not comfortable with heights, mention this to the operator beforehand.

## Gear and Preparation

| Option | Best For | Difficulty | Location |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Afon Mellte with TYF Adventure | Families, first-timers | Easy | Brecon Beacons National Park |
| Zip World Gorge Walking | Adventurous beginners | Moderate | Betws-y-Coed, Eryri (Snowdonia) |

## Practical Tips

- Wear appropriate footwear. Old trainers or walking shoes are ideal – avoid sandals or flip-flops. They need to be sturdy enough to grip slippery rocks and protect your feet.
- Pack a waterproof camera or phone case. You'll want to capture the experience, but electronics and water don't mix!
- Bring a towel and a complete change of clothes. There's no getting around it – you will get wet! Having warm, dry clothes to change into afterwards is essential, especially on cooler days.
- Check the weather forecast beforehand. Gorge walking is still fun in the rain, but be prepared for potentially colder conditions and faster-flowing water. Operators will usually cancel trips if the water levels are dangerously high.
