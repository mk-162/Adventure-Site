# Activity + Region Combo Pages — Content Brief

## The Concept

These are rich, SEO-optimised "linkbait" pages for every meaningful **activity + region** combination. Think `/snowdonia/things-to-do/hiking`, `/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/surfing`, `/gower/things-to-do/coasteering`.

They're NOT just filtered listings. They're **destination content hubs** — the definitive page for "hiking in Snowdonia" or "surfing in Pembrokeshire". They should rank for those exact search terms and become the go-to resource.

Each page aggregates: editorial content, bookable activities, related journal posts, YouTube videos, practical info, FAQs, and operator listings.

## Content Structure Per Page

Every activity+region page needs the following sections. This is the content template.

### 1. Hero Section
- **Hero image**: Activity-specific + region-specific composite image
  - Naming convention: `/images/combo/{region}-{activity}-hero.jpg`
  - Example: `/images/combo/snowdonia-hiking-hero.jpg`
  - Size: 1920×1080, landscape, high quality JPEG
  - Should show the actual activity happening in that specific region
  - Alt text: "Hiking in Snowdonia — [specific description of what's shown]"
- **H1**: "{Activity} in {Region}" — e.g. "Hiking in Snowdonia"
- **Strapline**: One punchy sentence. e.g. "From Snowdon's summit to hidden cwm trails — Wales's most dramatic hiking terrain."
- **Quick stats bar**: Number of routes/experiences, difficulty range, price range, best season

### 2. Introduction (300–500 words)
This is the editorial heart. Write it like a knowledgeable local friend, not a tourism board.

Must include:
- Why this region is specifically great for this activity (not generic waffle)
- What makes it different from doing the same activity elsewhere in Wales
- Who it's best for (families, beginners, experienced, adrenaline junkies)
- A hook for the reader to keep scrolling
- Naturally include the target keyword 2-3 times

**Tone**: Honest, opinionated, practical. "Snowdonia isn't just good hiking — it's some of the most dramatic mountain terrain in the UK. But it'll bite you if you're not prepared."

### 3. Top Spots / Routes Section
The centrepiece. 5–10 specific spots/routes for this activity in this region.

- Size: 1200×800, JPEG, optimised for web (<200KB each)
- Each image needs: alt text, caption, credit (if applicable)

### 5. YouTube Video Section
Each page should embed 2–4 relevant YouTube videos. These add massive SEO value and engagement.

**How to find videos:**
- Search YouTube for "{activity} in {region}" and "{region} {activity} guide"
- Prioritise: recent (last 2-3 years), high quality, from real creators (not AI slop)

### Research Process Per Combo Page

1. **Search Google Maps** for "{activity} {region}" — capture all relevant businesses
2. **Search Google** for "best {activity} {region}" — note any businesses/venues mentioned in top results
3. **Check TripAdvisor/AllTrails/Strava** for venues and popular spots
4. **Check existing DB** — mark which ones we already have (`inDatabase: true`)
5. **Flag gaps** — businesses with `priority: critical` that we're missing
6. **Capture Google ratings** — these become trust signals on the page
7. **Note postcodes** — even if exact lat/lng unavailable, postcode enables geocoding later

### Minimum Discovery Targets Per Combo Page

| Type | Minimum | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Activity providers | 3-5 | All the main ones operating in this area |
| Gear shops | 1-3 | The go-to shops for this activity |
| Venues/trail centres | ALL | These are finite and well-known — don't miss any |
| Post-activity spots | 2-4 | The ones the community actually uses |
| Clubs | 1-2 | If they exist |
| Attractions | 1-3 | Complementary things to do nearby |

### What Happens After Research

1. Research AI delivers combo page JSON with `discoveredBusinesses` array
2. We review the list against the operators DB
3. Missing critical/high priority businesses get seeded into the operators table
4. The combo page then auto-populates from the DB
5. Over time, operators claim their listings and enhance them (commercial flywheel)

This turns the research phase into a **database growth engine** — every combo page researched = 10-20 potential new operator listings.

### Hero Images (1 per page)
- **Size**: 1920×1080, JPEG
- **Naming**: `/images/combo/{region}-{activity}-hero.jpg`

## SEO & Keyword Strategy

These pages exist to capture high-intent traffic. Every page targets a primary keyword cluster and a set of long-tail variants. This is the whole point — get this right.

### Keyword Research Per Page

Each JSON file must include a `keywords` block:

```json
"keywords": {
  "primary": "hiking in snowdonia",
  "secondary": [
    "snowdonia hiking routes",
    "best hikes snowdonia",
    "walking in snowdonia",
    "snowdonia walks"
  ],
  "longTail": [
    "best easy hikes in snowdonia",
    "snowdonia hiking routes for beginners",
    "hardest hikes in snowdonia",
    "snowdonia scrambles",
    "dog friendly walks snowdonia",
    "snowdonia hikes with parking",
    "family walks snowdonia",
    "snowdonia winter hiking",
    "snowdonia hiking map",
    "guided walks snowdonia"
  ],
  "localIntent": [
    "hiking near llanberis",
    "walks near betws-y-coed",
    "hikes near beddgelert",
    "trails near capel curig"
  ],
  "commercialIntent": [
    "snowdonia guided walks price",
    "hire hiking gear snowdonia",
    "snowdonia walking holidays",
    "snowdonia hiking guide book"
  ]
}
```

**How to research keywords:**
1. Google the primary keyword — note "People Also Ask" questions (use these as FAQs)
2. Check Google autocomplete — type "{activity} in {region}" and note suggestions
3. Check related searches at bottom of Google results
4. Use variations: "hiking" vs "walking" vs "walks" vs "trails" vs "routes"
5. Include "near {town}" variants for local intent
6. Include commercial intent: "guided", "hire", "book", "price", "cost"

### On-Page SEO Requirements

- **Title tag**: "{Activity} in {Region}: [Compelling Suffix] | Adventure Wales" — max 60 chars
  - Example: "Hiking in Snowdonia: Best Routes & Walks | Adventure Wales"
- **Meta description**: Action-oriented, includes keyword, max 155 chars
  - Example: "Complete guide to hiking in Snowdonia. 10 best routes from easy valley walks to expert scrambles. Parking, gear, weather advice & booking."
- **H1**: "{Activity} in {Region}" (exact match primary keyword)
- **H2s**: Use secondary keywords naturally
  - "Best Hiking Routes in Snowdonia"
  - "Where to Hire Gear in Snowdonia"
  - "Guided Walks in Snowdonia"
  - "Hiking Conditions & Weather"
- **URL**: `/{region}/things-to-do/{activity}` (already set up)

### Schema Markup (auto-generated by the page component)
- **FAQPage** — every FAQ section
- **BreadcrumbList** — Home > Region > Things to Do > Activity
- **LocalBusiness** — every operator/shop listed
- **ItemList** — for the spots/routes list
- **Place** — for each spot with lat/lng
- **Event** — for each listed event
- **VideoObject** — for each YouTube embed
- **Article** — for related journal posts

### Internal Linking Strategy
Every combo page should link to:
- Individual activity pages (from bookable experiences)
- Operator directory pages
- Related journal posts
- Related itineraries
- Region page
- Other combo pages (nearby alternatives)
- Safety pages
- Gear guide pages

The page should **receive** links from:
- Homepage (if featured)
- Region page sidebar/body
- Activity type index page
- Journal posts about this combo
- Itineraries that include this activity
- Other combo pages (nearby alternatives)

### Content Authority Signals
What makes Google rank this page as THE authority:

1. **Depth**: 2,000-4,000 words of original content
2. **Specificity**: Real place names, grid references, prices, distances — not waffle
3. **Freshness**: YouTube embeds, event dates, seasonal advice, "updated 2025"
4. **Local knowledge**: Insider tips, parking secrets, quiet alternatives
5. **E-E-A-T signals**: Operator listings with Google ratings, verified businesses, real reviews
6. **User intent coverage**: Informational (routes), navigational (maps), commercial (book/hire), transactional (operators)
7. **Rich media**: Images, video embeds, maps — all relevant, not stock
8. **Business listings**: Gear shops, operators, cafes = LOCAL authority that generic blogs can't match
9. **Structured data**: Schema markup for every entity type
10. **Internal mesh**: Links to/from every related page on the site

## Start Here

Begin with the **Tier 1** list (10 combos). Deliver them in this order:
1. `snowdonia--hiking`
2. `pembrokeshire--surfing`
3. `pembrokeshire--coasteering`
4. `snowdonia--climbing`
5. `gower--surfing`
6. `snowdonia--zip-lining`
7. `brecon-beacons--hiking`
8. `snowdonia--mountain-biking`
9. `pembrokeshire--kayaking`
10. `snowdonia--gorge-walking`

Each one should take focused research. Don't rush — accuracy and specificity is what makes these pages rank. Generic content is worthless.

---
---

# Part 2: "Best Of" List Pages

## The Concept

Separate ranked list pages that target "best X in Y" keywords. These are a different search intent from the combo hub pages — people searching "best hikes in Snowdonia" want a ranked, opinionated list, not a comprehensive directory.

**URL structure**: `/{region}/best-{activity}` or `/{region}/best-{noun-plural}`
- `/snowdonia/best-hikes`
- `/pembrokeshire/best-surf-spots`
- `/gower/best-beaches`
- `/brecon-beacons/best-walks`
- `/snowdonia/best-scrambles`
- `/anglesey/best-kayaking-spots`

These pages **link heavily** to the combo pages (and vice versa), creating a tight internal link cluster around each activity+region topic.

## How They Differ From Combo Pages

| | Combo Page | Best Of List |
|--|-----------|-------------|
| **URL** | `/{region}/things-to-do/{activity}` | `/{region}/best-{activity}` |
| **Intent** | Comprehensive guide ("tell me everything") | Ranked list ("what's the best?") |
| **Keyword** | "hiking in snowdonia" | "best hikes in snowdonia" |
| **Tone** | Authoritative resource | Opinionated, ranked, "our picks" |
| **Content** | 2,000-4,000 words, multiple sections | 1,500-2,500 words, tight list format |
| **Operators/shops** | Full directory | Light — link to combo page |
| **Updates** | Seasonal | Annual "Updated 2025" refresh |

They complement each other. The combo page is the hub. The best-of list is the viral, shareable, snackable version that drives traffic into the hub.

## Priority Lists (Create These First)

## Content Structure Per List Page

### 1. Hero Section
- **Hero image**: Stunning landscape of the #1 pick
- **H1**: "X Best {Activity Spots} in {Region} (2025)"
  - Example: "10 Best Hikes in Snowdonia (2025)"
- **Strapline**: Opinionated one-liner
  - "From Snowdon's summit to secret cwm walks — our honest picks."
- **Author byline**: "By Adventure Wales | Updated [Month] 2025"
- **Quick jump links**: Numbered anchor links to each entry

### 2. Introduction (150-250 words)
Short, punchy, sets the scene.
- Why we made this list
- How we picked them (we've done them / our criteria)
- Quick summary of the range (easy to expert, free to £X)
- Who this list is for

### 3. The Ranked List (the content)

**Each entry — this is the star of the page:**

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Rank | #1, #2, etc. | ✅ |
| Name | "Crib Goch" | ✅ |
| One-line verdict | "The most exhilarating ridge walk in Wales — if you've got the nerve." | ✅ |
| Image | Specific to this spot, landscape, 1200×800 | ✅ |
| Why it made the list | 2-3 sentences, honest and specific | ✅ |
| Key stats | Difficulty, duration, distance, elevation, cost | ✅ |
| Best for | "Experienced scramblers wanting an adrenaline hit" | ✅ |
| Skip if | "You don't like exposure or are nervous on scrambles" | ✅ |
| Insider tip | One non-obvious tip | ✅ |
| Season | When to go | ✅ |
| Parking | Where + cost | ✅ |
| Start point | Lat/lng | ✅ |
| Link to full guide | → combo page or activity page | ✅ |
| Operator | If guided version available, link to operator | If applicable |
| YouTube video ID | Relevant video for this specific entry | If available |

**Ranking criteria** (state these on the page for transparency):
- Quality of experience
- Scenery/drama
- Accessibility (variety of difficulty levels across the list)
- Unique factor (what makes it special vs alternatives)
- Practical factors (parking, facilities, safety)

**List structure rules:**
- #1 should be the genuinely best, not the most famous
- Mix difficulties — don't make it all expert-level
- Include at least 1-2 "hidden gem" picks that aren't in every other list
- Include at least 1 "accessible/beginner" option
- Be honest about downsides — "busy", "hard to park", "overrated on weekends"
- The ranking should be OPINIONATED — that's what makes it shareable

### 4. Comparison Table
A quick-scan summary table below the list:

| # | Name | Difficulty | Duration | Cost | Best For |
|---|------|-----------|----------|------|----------|
| 1 | Crib Goch | Expert | 7h | Free | Adrenaline seekers |
| 2 | Tryfan North Ridge | Challenging | 5h | Free | Confident scramblers |
| ... | | | | | |

### 5. Map
Interactive map showing all entries with numbered pins.

### 6. "How We Picked These" (transparency box)
2-3 sentences explaining criteria. Builds trust.
- "We've hiked all of these routes ourselves..."
- "Our rankings factor in scenery, challenge, accessibility, and how busy they get..."

### 7. Seasonal Recommendations
Quick callout box:
- **Spring picks**: #3, #7 (wildflowers, waterfalls flowing)
- **Summer picks**: #1, #2 (long daylight, dry rock)
- **Autumn picks**: #5, #8 (colours, quieter)
- **Winter picks**: #4, #9 (dramatic, fewer crowds) — with warnings

### 8. Related Content Links
- Link to combo page: "Full guide to {activity} in {region} →"
- Link to related lists: "See also: Best Easy Walks in Snowdonia →"
- Link to relevant itineraries
- Link to gear guide

### 9. FAQs (3-5)
Different from the combo page FAQs — more "best of" focused:
- "What's the best hike in Snowdonia for beginners?"
- "Which Snowdonia walk has the best views?"
- "Can you hike Snowdon with kids?"

## Internal Linking Strategy (Combo + Best-Of Cluster)

This is how the pages work together to dominate search:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │   Region Page        │

```

**Every best-of list links to:**
- Its parent combo page (prominent "Full Guide →" link)
- Each individual activity/operator page
- Related best-of lists (same region or same activity)
- Relevant journal posts

**Every combo page links to:**
- All its child best-of lists
- All individual activity pages
- Related combo pages

**This creates topical clusters** that signal to Google: "this site is THE authority on hiking in Snowdonia".

## Production Order

**Phase 1**: Combo pages (Tier 1 — 10 pages)
**Phase 2**: Best-of lists for those same combos (Tier 1 — 10 lists)
**Phase 3**: Tier 2 combos + Tier 2 best-of lists
**Phase 4**: Niche/long-tail lists (Tier 3)

Start combo pages first — they're the hubs. Then layer best-of lists on top to capture the "best X" keywords and drive traffic into the hubs.
