# Fishing Safety in Wales

Fishing is one of the most relaxing activities in Wales — until it isn't. Welsh rivers can rise dramatically after rain, sea conditions change with the tide, and remote mountain llyns are a long way from help. A bit of awareness keeps a good day from turning bad.

## Rod Licences — The Legal Bit

This catches people out, so let's be clear:

- **Freshwater fishing**: You NEED a rod licence. Required for all fishing in rivers, lakes and canals in Wales. Enforced by Natural Resources Wales (NRW), and bailiffs do check — particularly on popular rivers like the Wye, Dee and Teifi.
- **Cost**: Around £30/year for trout and coarse, £82 for salmon/sea trout. Day licences available from ~£6.
- **Buy online**: From the Environment Agency website (yes, even for fishing in Wales — it's a shared system). Takes 2 minutes.
- **Fine for fishing without one**: Up to £2,500. Not worth the risk.
- **Sea fishing**: NO licence needed. Fish from the shore or a charter boat without any licence at all.

### Permits
A rod licence gives you the legal right to fish. But most rivers and lakes also require a **day permit** from the local angling association or landowner. These are typically £5–20 per day — check fishingwales.net for specifics. Fishing without permission is trespass, and the angling community takes a dim view of poaching.

## River Safety

Welsh rivers are beautiful but they deserve respect. They're often faster, deeper and colder than they look.

### Wading
- **Don't wade without proper boots** — felt-soled or studded wading boots grip on rocks. Smooth-soled boots on wet rock is a recipe for a dunking.
- **Use a wading staff** in faster water — a third point of contact makes a real difference.
- **Never wade above your waist** — the water pressure on your chest makes it very difficult to stay upright.
- **Side-on to the current** — present the narrowest profile to the flow.
- **Wear a wading belt** — cinches your waders at the waist and prevents them flooding if you go under. This is genuinely life-saving kit.
- **Watch for undercut banks** — Welsh rivers often have deep, invisible undercuts where the bank has eroded beneath the surface.

### Rising Water
Welsh rivers can rise **very fast** after rain — especially in the Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia and Mid Wales hills. What was shin-deep in the morning can be waist-deep by afternoon.

- **Check the forecast before you go** — not just rain where you are, but rain in the headwaters upstream.
- **Watch the water colour** — if it starts turning cloudy or brown, the river is rising. Get out.
- **Know your exit points** — identify easy bank access before you start wading. Don't get caught with steep banks on both sides and a rising river.
- **NRW river level data**: Check online before you go. Real-time river level monitoring is available for most major Welsh rivers.

### Cold Water
Welsh rivers are cold, even in summer. Water temperatures of 8–14°C are typical. If you fall in:
- Cold water shock can make you gasp and inhale water — try to control your breathing
- Get out quickly, strip off wet clothing, warm up gradually
- Hypothermia can set in faster than you think, especially on remote mountain streams

## Sea Fishing Safety

### Tides
This is the big one for sea anglers. Welsh tides are significant — up to 10 metres of range in the Bristol Channel.

- **Always check tide times** before fishing from rocks or beaches
- **Rock fishing**: Know your escape route. Platforms that are accessible at low tide can be submerged (or cut off) within hours. The Pembrokeshire coast is particularly notorious for this.
- **Beach fishing**: Some beaches become completely inaccessible at high tide. Three Cliffs Bay on the Gower, for example, becomes cut off.
- **Allow a margin** — don't wait until the tide reaches you. Start packing up well before high water.

### Shore Fishing Hazards
- **Wet rocks are lethal** — seaweed-covered rocks are incredibly slippery. Studded boots help but aren't magic.
- **Rogue waves**: Even on calm days, occasional larger waves can sweep rock platforms. Stay well above the splash zone.
- **Casting**: Check behind you before casting. Hooks in the back of someone's head ruin everyone's day.
- **Buoyancy aids**: Seriously consider wearing one when rock fishing. It's not uncool — it's sensible. The RNLI recommends it.

### Charter Boat Safety
Charter skippers handle most safety concerns, but:
- **Take seasickness tablets** before boarding, not after you feel ill. The Pembrokeshire coast can be choppy.
- **Wear the lifejacket** provided. Every time.
- **Listen to the safety briefing** — it's short and it matters.
- **Sunscreen and layers** — it's colder and sunnier on the water than you expect.

## Mountain Llyn Fishing

Fishing remote mountain lakes in Snowdonia or the Brecon Beacons is magical but isolated.

- **Tell someone where you're going** and when you expect to return
- **Mobile signal is patchy or non-existent** at many mountain llyns. Don't rely on your phone.
- **Carry a basic first aid kit**, waterproof clothing, and emergency shelter
- **The weather can change quickly** — mountain fog can descend in minutes. Carry a map and compass (and know how to use them).
- **Boggy ground**: The approaches to many llyns cross boggy moorland. Proper walking boots essential.

## Catch and Release

Many Welsh rivers, particularly those with salmon and sea trout, operate catch and release policies — either mandatory or strongly encouraged. This is about preserving fish stocks, not spoiling your fun. Handle fish carefully:
- Wet your hands before touching a fish
- Use barbless or micro-barbed hooks
- Keep the fish in the water as much as possible
- Support the fish upright in the current until it swims away strongly

## Emergency Contacts

- **Coastguard**: 999 (for any sea fishing emergency)
- **Mountain Rescue**: 999 (for remote lake/river emergencies)
- **NRW emergency hotline**: 0300 065 3000 (pollution, poaching reports)
- **Nearest hospital**: Know where it is. Many fishing spots are an hour or more from A&E.

## Kit Checklist

- Rod licence (freshwater) and day permit
- Wading boots with studs (river fishing)
- Wading belt
- Buoyancy aid (rock fishing)
- Polarised sunglasses (helps see fish AND protects eyes from hooks)
- First aid kit
- Waterproof jacket
- Mobile phone in a waterproof case
- Tide tables (sea fishing)
- Landing net and unhooking mat (for safe catch and release)
