# What Should I Expect on My First Kayaking Experience?

## Quick Answer

Expect a safety briefing, basic paddle instruction, and then time on the water — anywhere from sheltered river sections to guided sea kayaking along dramatic coastline. You'll get wet (possibly very wet), your arms will ache, and you'll probably wobble a lot at first. It's enormous fun. Wales offers everything from gentle river paddling to world-class sea kayaking.

## What to Expect on the Water

### Before You Launch

Every session starts on dry land. Your instructor will cover:
*   **How to hold the paddle** — most beginners grip it wrong (hands too close together)
*   **Forward stroke, reverse stroke, and steering** — the basics that let you actually go where you want
*   **What to do if you capsize** — it happens, and knowing the drill removes the panic
*   **Safety signals** and how the group will communicate on the water

You'll be fitted with a buoyancy aid (PFD) and given a spray deck if you're in a sit-in kayak. All provided by the operator.

### On the Water

The first 10 minutes are the wobbliest. Sit-on-top kayaks are more stable (and easier to get back on if you fall off). Sit-in sea kayaks are faster and drier, but feel tippy until you relax. The key is: **relax your hips and let the boat move beneath you.**

After 20-30 minutes, it clicks. You stop fighting the kayak, your strokes become more efficient, and you start actually looking at the scenery instead of your paddle. This is when it gets brilliant.

**Sea kayaking** along the Pembrokeshire or Anglesey coast is the headline experience. Paddling past sea caves, arches, and seal colonies with 100-metre cliffs above you is genuinely awe-inspiring. Conditions can change though — your guide will manage this.

**River kayaking** on the Wye or Teifi is gentler and more relaxing. Wildlife spotting (kingfishers, herons, otters if you're lucky) is a big part of the appeal. Perfect for families.

**Lake kayaking** on Llyn Padarn or Llyn Tegid (Bala Lake) is calm and scenic — a great first-time option if open water makes you nervous.

## Choosing the Right Experience

| Type | Best For | Difficulty | Top Locations |
|------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Sea kayaking | Coastal scenery, wildlife, adventure | Moderate (weather-dependent) | [Pembrokeshire](/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/kayaking), [Anglesey](/anglesey/things-to-do/kayaking) |
| River kayaking/canoeing | Relaxed paddling, families, wildlife | Easy | River Wye, River Teifi |
| Lake kayaking | Calm water, beginners, mountain views | Easy | Llyn Padarn (Snowdonia), Llyn Tegid (Bala) |
| Stand-up paddleboarding | Balance challenge, calmer water | Easy-Moderate | Gower, Pembrokeshire, lakes |

## What to Wear

*   **Quick-drying layers** — synthetic base layer, fleece mid-layer. No cotton.
*   **Waterproof jacket** — you'll get splashed even on calm days
*   **Shoes that can get wet** — old trainers or water shoes. Not flip-flops.
*   **Sunscreen and hat** — sun reflects off the water intensely
*   **Spare dry clothes in the car** — you'll want them

In cooler months (or for sea kayaking), some operators provide wetsuits or spray jackets. Ask when booking.

## Practical Tips

*   **Book in advance** during May-September. Popular Pembrokeshire operators fill up days ahead, especially for half-day sea kayaking sessions.
*   **Check the weather.** Sea kayaking in wind is significantly harder (and potentially dangerous). Good operators cancel or reroute in poor conditions — that's a sign of quality.
*   **Eat before you go.** Paddling burns more energy than you'd expect, especially against wind or current.
*   **Sunscreen is essential.** The water reflection doubles the UV exposure. You will burn on a "cloudy" day.
*   **Don't fight the wobble.** Tensing up makes you less stable. Relax, keep your centre of gravity low, and let the kayak do its thing.
*   **Your arms will ache.** Especially your shoulders. This is normal and eases as your technique improves.

## The Smart Choice

For a first-time kayaker in Wales: if you want scenery and adventure, book a guided **sea kayaking session in Pembrokeshire** — the St Davids coastline is world-class. If you want something gentler for the family, the **River Wye between Hay-on-Wye and Monmouth** is beautiful and relaxed. If you just want to try kayaking without committing to a full session, hire a sit-on-top at **Llyn Padarn** and paddle at your own pace.
