# Which Snowdon Route Should I Take?

## Quick Answer

The best Snowdon route for you depends on your experience, fitness level, and preferred difficulty. For beginners or those seeking a gentler climb, the Llanberis Path is the longest but least challenging. Experienced hikers and scramblers looking for adventure should consider Crib Goch, but be aware of its exposed knife-edge ridge.

## Snowdon Routes Compared

Snowdon offers a variety of routes to the summit, each with its own character and challenges. Here’s a breakdown of some popular options:

*   **Llanberis Path:** The longest and most gradual route, suitable for beginners and families. It follows a well-maintained path with steady inclines.
*   **Snowdon Ranger Path:** A slightly shorter and quieter alternative to the Llanberis Path, offering scenic views. The initial section is steep, but it becomes more moderate.
*   **Miner's Track:** A popular route with a relatively easy start, passing by the picturesque Llyn Llydaw and Glaslyn lakes. The final ascent is a bit steeper.
*   **Watkin Path:** The most challenging of the standard routes, with a significant ascent and varied terrain, including a waterfall section. Offers a sense of remoteness.
*   **Rhyd-Ddu Path:** A quieter and more scenic route than the Llanberis and Miner's Paths. It offers stunning views and a moderate level of difficulty.
*   **Crib Goch:** Only suitable for experienced scramblers. This is a grade 1 scramble and involves exposed knife-edge ridges and requires a head for heights. It's best tackled in good weather conditions. Consider a guided walk with MountainXperience or Snowdonia Mountain Guides if you're unsure.
