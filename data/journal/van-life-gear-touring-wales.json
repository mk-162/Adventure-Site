This is what you *actually* need, learned from years of campervan touring from Anglesey to the Brecon Beacons.\n\n# Van Life Gear for Touring Wales\n\nRight then, let's be straight \u2013 van life in Wales isn't all Instagram sunsets and perfectly brewed coffee overlooking Cardigan Bay. It's often wet, occasionally windy, and sometimes involves wrestling with midges the size of small aircraft. But with the right gear, it's absolutely worth it. Forget the fancy gadgets; focus on practical stuff that'll keep you warm, dry, and (relatively) sane.\n\n## The Essentials: Weatherproofing and Comfort\n\nWelsh weather is notoriously\u2026unpredictable. One minute you\u2019re basking in sunshine, the next you\u2019re battling a horizontal downpour. Prioritise these:\n\n*   **Waterproof Awning/Shelter:** A decent awning is non-negotiable. Something like the Vango AirBeam awning (from \u00a3300 new, but often findable secondhand) will give you vital living space when the heavens open. Seriously, you'll be grateful for the extra room to dry soggy hiking boots after a day on the trails around the Brecon Beacons.\n*   **Good Waterproofs:** Forget fashion, think function. A proper waterproof jacket and trousers are worth their weight in gold. Expect to pay \u00a3150-\u00a3300 for a decent set. Look for Gore-Tex or similar breathable fabrics. Berghaus Deluge trousers are a reliable, relatively affordable option. They won't last forever, but they'll get you started.\n*   **Warm Layers:** Fleece jackets, thermal underwear, and a good hat and gloves are essential, even in summer. Merino wool is excellent but pricey; synthetic alternatives are perfectly adequate. Pack for all seasons, even if you're visiting in July. Nights can get chilly, especially up in Snowdonia.\n*   **Decent Bedding:** Don\u2019t skimp on your sleeping bag. A four-season sleeping bag is overkill for summer, but a good three-season (comfort rating around 0\u00b0C) will keep you toasty. Consider a memory foam mattress topper for extra comfort \u2013 your back will thank you after a day tackling the MinorTaur trail at Coed y Brenin forest park (\u00a32-7 parking).\n*   **Wellies:** Essential for muddy campsites and wet beaches. Get a good pair, not the cheap flimsy ones from the petrol station. Aigle or Le Chameau are pricey but last for years.\n\n## Cooking and Campsite Must-Haves\n\nEating well is crucial for morale on any road trip. Keep it simple, keep it efficient:\n\n*   **Portable Stove:** A two-burner gas stove is ideal for cooking proper meals. Cadac stoves are a good option, allowing you to barbecue, grill, or use as a conventional hob. Expect to pay around \u00a3100-\u00a3200. Don't forget a spare gas canister!\n*   **Cooking Utensils and Crockery:** Keep it minimal \u2013 a couple of pots and pans, a sharp knife, and durable plates and cutlery. Enamelware is classic campervan style and pretty indestructible.\n*   **Coolbox/Fridge:** A 12V coolbox is a good starting point, but a proper fridge is a game-changer if you plan on longer trips. Expect to pay \u00a3200-\u00a3500 for a decent 12V fridge. Consider your power consumption, especially if you\u2019re relying on solar.\n*   **Water Container:** A large water container (20 litres or more) is essential. Consider getting one with a tap for easy access.\n*   **Washing Up:** A collapsible washing-up bowl, biodegradable soap, and a good sponge are crucial for keeping things clean.\n*   **Camping Chairs and Table:** Invest in comfortable camping chairs and a sturdy table. You'll be spending a lot of time sitting outside, so make sure they're up to the job.\n*   **Head Torch:** Essential for navigating campsites in the dark. Get a decent one with a good beam and long battery life. Petzl or Black Diamond are reliable brands.\n\n## Power and Technology\n\nStaying connected and powered up is increasingly important, but don't let technology dominate your trip:\n\n*   **Leisure Battery:** A good leisure battery is essential for powering your fridge, lights, and charging your devices. Consider the amp-hour (Ah) rating \u2013 the higher the rating, the more power you'll have.\n*   **Solar Panel:** A solar panel can help to keep your leisure battery topped up, especially if you're wild camping. A 100W panel is a good starting point.\n*   **Inverter:** An inverter allows you to run mains-powered devices (laptops, hairdryers) from your leisure battery. Choose an inverter with enough power for your needs.\n*   **Phone Signal Booster:** Mobile signal can be patchy in rural areas of Wales. A phone signal booster can improve your connection.\n*   **Navigation:** Don't rely solely on your phone. A paper map and compass are essential for hiking and navigating remote areas. Ordnance Survey maps are the gold standard. If you're planning on exploring the Llyn Peninsula, get the relevant OS map before you go.\n*   **Power Bank:** Always have a fully charged power bank for emergencies.\n\n## Safety and Practicalities\n\nDon't overlook these essential items:\n\n*   **First Aid Kit:** A comprehensive first aid kit is non-negotiable. Make sure it includes plasters, bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relief, and any personal medication.\n*   **Fire Extinguisher and Carbon Monoxide Alarm:** These are essential safety items. Test them regularly.\n*   **Jump Leads:** You never know when you might need them.\n*   **Tow Rope:** Useful for getting unstuck.\n*   **Warning Triangle:** In case of a breakdown.\n*   **Levelling Chocks:** For keeping your van level on uneven ground.\n*   **Wheel Chocks:** For added safety on hills.\n*   **Insect Repellent:** Midges can be a nightmare, especially in the evenings. Smidge is a popular and effective repellent.\n*   **Sunscreen:** Even on cloudy days, the Welsh sun can be surprisingly strong.\n*   **Clothes Line and Pegs:** For drying wet clothes.\n*   **Bin Bags:** For responsible waste disposal.\n*   **Toilet Chemicals (if you have a toilet):** Essential for keeping your toilet clean and odour-free.\n*   **Door wedge:** Sometimes you just want to enjoy the view.\n\n## Hire vs. Buy: Making the Right Choice\n\nFor some items, hiring makes sense, especially if you're new to van life or only planning a short trip. Things like awnings or even portable toilets can be hired from various camping shops and online retailers. However, for essential safety gear, cooking equipment, and bedding, buying is usually the best option.\n\n## Welsh Van Life: Beyond the Gear\n\nRemember, the best gear in the world won't guarantee a perfect trip. A sense of adventure, a willingness to embrace the unpredictable, and a healthy dose of humour are equally important. Plan your route carefully, taking into account the narrow roads and limited parking in some areas. Consider exploring the Gower Peninsula, with its stunning beaches and coastal walks. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is another fantastic option, but be prepared for challenging terrain. And don't forget to factor in time for exploring the local villages and sampling some Welsh cuisine (Welsh cakes are a must!).\n\nUltimately, van life in Wales is about freedom and flexibility. With the right gear and a bit of planning, you can create unforgettable memories exploring this beautiful country. Just be prepared for the rain! And maybe pack an extra jumper.",
