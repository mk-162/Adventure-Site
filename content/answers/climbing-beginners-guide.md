# What are the best Climbing tips for beginners?

## Quick Answer

Start with indoor climbing to learn the basics at centres like Awesome Walls in Stockport or The Boardroom Climbing Centre in Deeside. Focus on proper technique and footwork, and don't be afraid to ask for guidance from experienced climbers. Once you're comfortable, consider an outdoor climbing course with a reputable operator like Gaia Adventures in Eryri (Snowdonia) to learn essential safety skills.

## Getting Started: Indoor Climbing in North Wales

Indoor climbing is an excellent way to build strength, technique, and confidence before heading outdoors. North Wales boasts several fantastic indoor climbing centres. Awesome Walls Stockport, while just over the border, is easily accessible and offers a huge variety of routes and bouldering problems for all levels. The Boardroom Climbing Centre in Deeside is another great option, known for its friendly atmosphere and excellent coaching. Expect to pay around £10-£15 for a day pass at most centres. Many centres also offer introductory courses for complete beginners, usually costing between £30-£50.

Before you even think about scaling a cliff face, master the basics. Focus on footwork – precise placement and using your legs to push yourself up, rather than relying solely on arm strength. Don't be afraid to ask more experienced climbers for advice; most climbers are happy to share their knowledge and offer tips. Remember, progress takes time, so be patient and enjoy the process!

## Taking it Outside: Guided Climbing Experiences

Once you've gained some experience indoors, the next step is to try outdoor climbing under the supervision of qualified instructors. Eryri (Snowdonia) is a world-class climbing destination, offering a huge range of routes for all abilities. Gaia Adventures, based in Eryri, offers a variety of climbing courses for beginners, from introductory days to multi-day courses covering essential skills such as rope work, belaying, and anchor building. A day's guided climbing typically costs between £80-£120 per person.

Another excellent option is to book a session with a local mountain guide. The Association of Mountaineering Instructors (AMI) website is a great resource for finding qualified and experienced guides in the area. When choosing an operator, make sure they are fully insured and have a proven track record of safety.
