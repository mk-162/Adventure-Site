# What is Coasteering?

## Quick Answer

Coasteering is an adventure activity that involves traversing a rocky coastline by any means necessary – swimming, scrambling, climbing, and jumping.  It's a unique blend of several outdoor pursuits, offering an exhilarating way to explore the intertidal zone. Participants wear wetsuits, buoyancy aids, and helmets for safety and warmth.

## The Detail

Coasteering is more than just a walk along the beach. You'll find yourself navigating slippery rocks, squeezing through narrow gullies, and leaping into deep pools. A typical coasteering session involves:

*   **Kitting Up:** Wetsuits are essential for warmth, as is a buoyancy aid. Helmets protect against bumps and scrapes on the rocks.
*   **Coastal Traverse:** Following a qualified guide, you'll explore the coastline, using a combination of walking, scrambling (using hands for balance on steeper sections), and swimming.
*   **Jumping:** A key element! Jumps can range from a few feet to more adrenaline-pumping heights (always optional). Experienced guides assess jump safety, considering tide levels, water depth, and potential hazards.
*   **Exploring Caves and Gullies:** Many coasteering routes incorporate exploring sea caves and narrow gullies, offering unique perspectives and challenges.
*   **Safety Briefing:** A thorough safety briefing is always provided at the start, covering essential techniques and emergency procedures.

Coasteering locations vary significantly.  Pembrokeshire in Wales is particularly well-known for its stunning coastline and excellent coasteering opportunities. Unlike gorge walking, which follows a river gorge inland, coasteering sticks to the sea's edge. It's generally more physically demanding than a gentle sea kayaking trip, involving more intense bursts of activity.

## The Smart Choice

If you're looking for an adrenaline-filled adventure that combines physical challenges with stunning coastal scenery, coasteering is an excellent choice. Choose a reputable provider with experienced guides and a strong safety record.  Consider your fitness level and comfort with heights before booking. If you're unsure, start with a "classic" coasteering route, which typically involves less demanding jumps. For a less intense coastal experience, consider sea kayaking. If you prefer inland water activity, gorge walking might be a better fit. I'd recommend the Coasteering Classic in Pembrokeshire for a good starting point.
