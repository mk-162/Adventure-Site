# Activity + Region Combo Pages — Content Brief

## The Concept

These are rich, SEO-optimised "linkbait" pages for every meaningful **activity + region** combination. Think `/snowdonia/things-to-do/hiking`, `/pembrokeshire/things-to-do/surfing`, `/gower/things-to-do/coasteering`.

They're NOT just filtered listings. They're **destination content hubs** — the definitive page for "hiking in Snowdonia" or "surfing in Pembrokeshire". They should rank for those exact search terms and become the go-to resource.

Each page aggregates: editorial content, bookable activities, related journal posts, YouTube videos, practical info, FAQs, and operator listings.

## Content Structure Per Page

Every activity+region page needs the following sections. This is the content template.

### 1. Hero Section
- **Hero image**: Activity-specific + region-specific composite image
  - Naming convention: `/images/combo/{region}-{activity}-hero.jpg`
  - Example: `/images/combo/snowdonia-hiking-hero.jpg`
  - Size: 1920×1080, landscape, high quality JPEG
  - Should show the actual activity happening in that specific region
  - Alt text: "Hiking in Snowdonia — [specific description of what's shown]"
- **H1**: "{Activity} in {Region}" — e.g. "Hiking in Snowdonia"
- **Strapline**: One punchy sentence. e.g. "From Snowdon's summit to hidden cwm trails — Wales's most dramatic hiking terrain."
- **Quick stats bar**: Number of routes/experiences, difficulty range, price range, best season

### 2. Introduction (300–500 words)
This is the editorial heart. Write it like a knowledgeable local friend, not a tourism board.

Must include:
- Why this region is specifically great for this activity (not generic waffle)
- What makes it different from doing the same activity elsewhere in Wales
- Who it's best for (families, beginners, experienced, adrenaline junkies)
- A hook for the reader to keep scrolling
- Naturally include the target keyword 2-3 times

**Tone**: Honest, opinionated, practical. "Snowdonia isn't just good hiking — it's some of the most dramatic mountain terrain in the UK. But it'll bite you if you're not prepared."

### 3. Top Spots / Routes Section
The centrepiece. 5–10 specific spots/routes for this activity in this region.

**How to find videos:**
- Search YouTube for "{activity} in {region}" and "{region} {activity} guide"
