We packed hiking, wild swimming, and caving into a few days, discovering both the beauty and the challenges of this Welsh national park.\n\n# Couples Weekend in the Brecon Beacons\n\nMy other half, Angharad, and I needed a break. City life was getting to us, and the Brecon Beacons seemed like the perfect antidote. We\u2019re both reasonably fit, enjoy a bit of a challenge, and aren\u2019t afraid to get muddy, so we planned a weekend packed with hiking, a bit of wild swimming, and a caving trip.\n\n## Planning & Getting There\n\nWe decided on a long weekend, driving up on Friday evening and heading back Sunday. Getting to the Brecon Beacons is pretty straightforward. From Cardiff, it\u2019s about an hour\u2019s drive, depending on where you\u2019re headed. We were aiming for the central part of the park, near Brecon itself, so it was an easy run up the A470. Be warned though, that road can get *busy* on a Friday, especially during school holidays.\n\nAccommodation-wise, we opted for a small, self-catering cottage near Talybont-on-Usk. It cost us \u00a3250 for the three nights. Plenty of campsites available too, if that's your thing, and would obviously be easier on the wallet. Make sure you book ahead, especially during peak season. We went in early September, which is usually a sweet spot \u2013 fewer crowds, but still decent weather (hopefully!).\n\n## Day 1: Pen y Fan Hike and a Cold Dip\n\nSaturday was hike day. We picked Pen y Fan, the highest peak in South Wales. It\u2019s a classic for a reason, with stunning views from the top (on a clear day, that is!).\n\nWe parked at the Pont ar Daf car park (expect to pay around \u00a35 for the day, card payments accepted). The main path up Pen y Fan is well-maintained but can be steep in places. It\u2019s a popular route, so expect to see plenty of other walkers. The crowds thin out a bit if you take one of the less-trodden paths, but be prepared for a tougher climb and potentially boggy conditions. We opted for the main path, wanting to save our energy for the afternoon.\n\nThe hike took us about 2 hours up and back, including a stop at the summit to scoff down some sandwiches and admire the (slightly hazy) view. If you're not a seasoned hiker, take your time and wear proper hiking boots. I saw a few people struggling in trainers.\n\nAfter the hike, we headed to a spot on the River Usk near Brecon for a wild swim. I\u2019d read about it online \u2013 a deep pool with a small waterfall. Finding it was a bit of an adventure in itself, involving some questionable map-reading skills and a near-miss with a herd of cows.\n\nThe water was *cold* \u2013 even for September. I'd estimate it was around 14 degrees. But it was incredibly refreshing after the hike. We only stayed in for about 10 minutes, but it was enough to invigorate us. If you're planning a wild swim, always check the water quality beforehand and be aware of the risks of cold water shock. A wetsuit would be a good idea unless you're properly acclimatised.\n\nParking near the river was free but limited, so get there early or be prepared to walk a bit.\n\n## Day 2: Caving with Black Mountain Adventure\n\nSunday was our caving day. We booked a half-day trip with Black Mountain Adventure, costing us \u00a365 each. We chose them because they had good reviews and offered a \"moderate\" caving experience, which seemed like a good fit for our abilities.\n\nThe meeting point was near Craig-y-nos Castle. The drive there from Talybont-on-Usk takes about 45 minutes via the A4067, a scenic road that winds its way through the valleys.\n\nThe caving itself was fantastic. We kitted up with helmets, head torches, and overalls and followed our guide, Rhys, into the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu National Nature Reserve cave system. It wasn\u2019t for the faint of heart. There were tight squeezes, slippery rocks, and plenty of crawling on our hands and knees. But it was an incredible experience, seeing the underground world and learning about the geology of the area. The \"moderate\" rating was accurate \u2013 challenging, but not overly technical.\n\nBlack Mountain Adventure provided all the necessary equipment. Wear old clothes you don\u2019t mind getting dirty, and ideally, walking boots.\n\n## What We Learned & Would Change\n\nThe Brecon Beacons is a great place for a couples\u2019 weekend adventure. We managed to pack a lot in, but it was also quite tiring. Next time, we might opt for a longer stay to spread the activities out a bit.\n\n**Things we\u2019d do differently:**\n\n*   **Check the weather forecast more closely.** We got lucky with sunshine on Saturday, but Sunday was much wetter. Caving is fine in the rain, but hiking wouldn't have been much fun.\n*   **Pack more snacks.** We underestimated how much energy we'd burn on the hike.\n*   **Bring a flask of hot tea for after the wild swim.** That would have been *amazing*.\n\n**Total cost for the weekend (excluding petrol):**\n\n*   Accommodation: \u00a3250\n*   Caving: \u00a3130\n*   Parking: \u00a35\n*   Food and drink: \u00a3100 (estimated)\n\n**Total: \u00a3485**\n\n## Other Options & Things to Consider\n\nThe Brecon Beacons has loads more to offer. If caving isn't your thing, consider gorge walking with Adventure Britain. Similar price range to caving, and equally exhilarating. Or, if you prefer two wheels, BikePark Wales offers mountain biking trails for all levels, with bike hire and coaching available. A day pass for the trails starts from around \u00a38.\n\nFor a less adrenaline-fueled activity, explore the numerous walking trails around Llangorse Lake, or even try some paddleboarding with Black Mountain Adventure.\n\nThe Brecon Beacons is dog-friendly in many areas, so if you're looking for a trip to bring your furry friend along, that's a good option to consider too.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more of Wales, why not combine a trip to the Brecon Beacons with a visit to the Gower Peninsula? It's only a short drive away and offers beautiful beaches and coastal walks. Or, for a more rugged adventure, head north to Snowdonia and tackle Snowdon itself. Both regions provide vastly different, but equally memorable, experiences.",
