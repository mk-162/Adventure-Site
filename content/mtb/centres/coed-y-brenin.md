# Coed y Brenin Mountain Biking

## The UK's Original Trail Centre

Coed y Brenin isn't just another trail centre — it's where UK mountain biking began. When the first purpose-built MTB trails opened here in 1996, they changed everything. Thirty years later, this forest park in the heart of Snowdonia remains the benchmark against which all other trail centres are measured.

The name means "King's Forest" in Welsh, and it lives up to the title. Eight waymarked trails thread through 9,000 acres of ancient woodland and dramatic hillside, from gentle green routes perfect for families to The Beast — 38km of relentless challenge that's broken stronger riders than you.

What makes Coed y Brenin special isn't just the trails (though they're exceptional). It's the complete package: the all-weather surfaces that drain like nowhere else in Wales, the café that's become a social hub for riders across North Wales, the bike hire and skills area that make it genuinely accessible to beginners, and the community that's built up around this place over three decades.

If you ride mountain bikes in the UK and haven't been to Coed y Brenin, you're missing a piece of history.

## The Trails

### 🟢 Yr Afon (Green)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 10.8 km |
| **Climbing** | ~150m |
| **Time** | 1-3 hours |
| **Surface** | Forest road |
| **Drainage** | Good |

Yr Afon (The River) is your entry point to Coed y Brenin. This green-graded route follows wide forest roads that contour around the hillside, offering stunning views of waterfalls without any technical demands. 

**Who it's for:** Complete beginners, families with young children, anyone getting back on a bike after years away, or experienced riders looking for a recovery spin.

**What to expect:** Smooth, wide surfaces throughout. The climbing is gentle but present — you'll gain elevation gradually. The descent back requires speed control; forest roads can be deceptively fast.

**Local tip:** Time your ride for late afternoon when the light hits the waterfalls. Bring a camera.

### 🔵 MinorTaur (Blue)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 12 km (3/5/9/12km options) |
| **Climbing** | ~200m |
| **Time** | 30 mins - 2 hours |
| **Surface** | Purpose-built singletrack |
| **Drainage** | Excellent |

The MinorTaur is probably the best beginner trail in Wales. Don't let the "blue" grade fool you — this isn't a watered-down compromise. It's a properly designed trail that happens to be accessible to developing riders.

**Who it's for:** Confident beginners ready to progress, families who want actual singletrack, intermediate riders warming up, anyone wanting flow without fear.

**What to expect:** The trail never narrows below 1.5 metres, so you've always got room to manoeuvre. You'll encounter berms, rollers, and gentle undulations — all the fun of mountain biking without the terrifying bits. The four loops (3/5/9/12km) mean you can bail early if legs or confidence fade.

**Why it works:** The MinorTaur teaches you what a mountain bike can do without punishing mistakes. Berms show you how to carry speed through corners. Rollers teach you to pump. By the end, you'll understand why people get addicted to this.

**Local tip:** Start with the 5km loop. If you're grinning, add the 9km extension. The full 12km is a proper workout.

### 🔴 Cyflym Coch (Red)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 11.2 km |
| **Climbing** | ~350m |
| **Time** | 1.5-3 hours |
| **Surface** | Technical singletrack |
| **Drainage** | Good |

Cyflym Coch means "Fast Red" in Welsh, and it's the gentlest gateway into red-grade riding at Coed y Brenin. The trail deliberately increases in difficulty as it progresses — testing you gradually rather than throwing you in at the deep end.

**Who it's for:** Blue-grade riders ready to progress, returning riders rebuilding fitness and nerve, anyone who wants red-grade bragging rights without red-grade terror.

**What to expect:** The first half lulls you into confidence with flowing singletrack and manageable features. Then come the named sections: **Dreamtime** (a flowing descent that rewards smooth riding) and **Uncle Fester** (where the rocks start demanding attention). By the end, you'll know if you're ready for the bigger reds.

**Honest warning:** This is still a red trail. You will encounter loose surfaces, off-camber sections, and features that require commitment. If the MinorTaur felt challenging, give yourself more time before tackling Cyflym Coch.

**Local tip:** Ride it twice in one visit. First lap is reconnaissance — second lap is where the fun really starts.

### 🔴 Temtiwr (Red)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 8.7 km |
| **Climbing** | ~250m |
| **Time** | 30 mins - 1 hour |
| **Surface** | Technical singletrack |
| **Drainage** | Good |

Don't be deceived by the short distance. Temtiwr packs more intensity into 8.7km than most trails manage in twice that. It's red-graded but contains black-rated TTFs (Technical Trail Features) — this is where Coed y Brenin stops holding your hand.

**Who it's for:** Confident red-grade riders looking for a concentrated hit, anyone building toward black trails, riders short on time but not on ambition.

**What to expect:** An undulating traverse to warm the legs, then a long fire road climb that tests your patience. The reward: a fast, demanding trio of descents. **Beginning of the End** sets up **Glide** (flowing but fast), which drops you into **Seven Sisters** — a rocky, technical finish that demands focus. 

**Honest warning:** Those black-rated TTFs aren't optional. You can't just "roll through" the technical sections. If you're dabbing on Cyflym Coch's features, you're not ready for Temtiwr.

**Local tip:** This trail rides best in dry conditions. The rocks in Seven Sisters get slippery when wet — and by slippery, we mean treacherous.

### 🔴 Dragon's Back (Red)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 31.1 km |
| **Climbing** | ~800m |
| **Time** | 3-5 hours |
| **Surface** | Technical singletrack |
| **Drainage** | Good |

The Dragon's Back is Coed y Brenin's longest red — a proper day out that's been challenging and delighting riders since the early days of the trail centre. This is classic cross-country mountain biking: big climbs earning bigger descents, technical terrain rewarding skilled riders.

**Who it's for:** Fit riders comfortable on red-grade terrain, anyone wanting an epic day out, riders training for endurance events.

**What to expect:** Tough climbing (800m over 31km adds up) broken by descents that make every pedal stroke worthwhile. The highlight is the **Addams Family** sequence — five named descents that flow top-to-bottom: **Gomez**, **Morticia**, **Pugsley**, **Lurch**, and finally **Uncle Fester**. Each has its own character; together they're a masterclass in trail design.

**Honest warning:** This is a long day. Bring food, water, spare tubes, and more food. The trail is remote in places — mechanical issues here aren't just inconvenient, they're adventures you don't want.

**Local tip:** Start early. You want to finish the Addams Family descents while your legs still have something to give. Tired legs plus technical terrain equals carnage.

### ⚫ Tarw Du (Black)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 20.2 km |
| **Climbing** | ~600m |
| **Time** | 1.5-3 hours |
| **Surface** | Technical singletrack |
| **Drainage** | Moderate |

Tarw Du (Black Bull) is Coed y Brenin's oldest trail and arguably its most characterful. This is where modern mountain biking in the UK started — and while newer trails have flashier features, nothing quite matches the raw feel of riding history.

**Who it's for:** Experienced riders who've mastered the reds, anyone wanting to tick off the iconic **Y Slab**, riders who appreciate old-school trail character over manicured perfection.

**What to expect:** The defining feature is **Y Slab** — a rock slab section that's become a pilgrimage site for UK mountain bikers. Beyond that, expect rocky, retro, twisty, technical trail throughout. This isn't the flowing, bermed singletrack of modern trail centres. It's rougher, rawer, and more demanding of your line choice.

**Honest warning:** Drainage is "moderate" — which means after rain, expect mud. The rocky sections get slippery. The slab is genuinely intimidating until you've ridden it (and sometimes after).

**Local tip:** Ride Y Slab early in your run, before tired legs make it scarier. Most people walk it on their first visit — there's no shame in that. But once you've rolled it, you'll want to do it again.

### ⚫ MBR (Black)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 18.4 km |
| **Climbing** | ~550m |
| **Time** | 1.5-3 hours |
| **Surface** | Technical singletrack |
| **Drainage** | Good |

Named after the magazine that put UK mountain biking on the map, the MBR trail does exactly what you'd hope: it packs the highlights from both Dragon's Back and The Beast into one concentrated hit. If you want maximum quality trail in minimum distance, this is it.

**Who it's for:** Experienced riders short on time, anyone wanting the best bits without the full Beast commitment, riders building toward the big one.

**What to expect:** The modernised **Able** section features rocky fly-offs that reward commitment. **False Teeth** has been recently updated and remains one of the most satisfying descents in the forest. This is relentlessly good trail — no filler sections, no boring transfers, just hit after hit.

**Honest warning:** Concentrated quality means concentrated difficulty. There's no easy way through MBR — every kilometre demands your attention. This isn't a trail for tired riders.

**Local tip:** Consider MBR as your second lap of the day — warm up on Cyflym Coch, then hit MBR while everything's dialled. You'll ride it better.

### ⚫ The Beast (Black)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 38.2 km |
| **Climbing** | ~1,000m |
| **Time** | 3-5 hours |
| **Surface** | Technical singletrack |
| **Drainage** | Moderate |

This is it. The Beast. Coed y Brenin's biggest challenge and one of the UK's most demanding trail centre routes. 38km of everything mountain biking can throw at you: fast open sections, tight technical bits, flowing singletrack, bone-shaking rocky terrain. If you complete The Beast, you've earned something.

**Who it's for:** Experienced, fit riders seeking a genuine challenge. Anyone who's ridden the other blacks and wants more. Riders training for endurance events who need trail time.

**What to expect:** 1,000m of climbing over 38km is no joke. The trail includes sections from other routes but links them with additional challenges. You'll encounter everything: flow, tech, speed, grind, and several moments where you question your life choices. The satisfaction at the end is proportional to the suffering along the way.

**Honest warning:** The Beast breaks people. Not through any single feature, but through relentless accumulation. At 30km, when your legs are screaming and concentration is wavering, you'll still have technical terrain ahead. Under-prepared riders end up walking significant sections, which destroys both the experience and the timing.

**Requirements:** 
- Proper fitness (you should be comfortable with 3+ hour rides)
- Confident black-grade skills
- Full hydration and nutrition strategy
- Mechanical competence (you're a long way from help if something breaks)
- The right mindset (this is an endurance event, not a casual ride)

**Local tip:** Don't attempt The Beast on your first visit to Coed y Brenin. Ride the other blacks first. Understand the terrain. Then come back for The Beast when you know what you're getting into.

## Facilities

### Beics Brenin (On-Site)

The bike shop at Coed y Brenin is run by Beics Brenin — and they're as much a part of the experience as the trails themselves.

**Bike Hire:** Full range from hardtails to e-MTBs. Book ahead for weekends. Quality is genuinely good — these aren't department store bikes.

**Bike Shop:** Well-stocked with spares, clothing, and essentials. If you've forgotten something, they'll have it.

**Servicing:** On-site workshop for mechanicals. They've seen every breakdown and can usually get you rolling again.

### Y Ffowndri (Skills Area)

Before hitting the trails, visit Y Ffowndri (The Foundry) — a dedicated skills area with sample sections of every grade. Not sure if you're ready for red? Try the red features here first. It's brilliant for building confidence and avoids unpleasant surprises on the actual trails.

### Café 

The café is genuinely good — not just "good for a trail centre." Post-ride coffee and cake is mandatory. Welsh cakes are the move.

### Other Facilities

- **Bike wash** — Pressure washer, brushes, the works
- **Showers** — Clean up before the drive home
- **Toilets** — 24-hour access
- **Parking** — Pay and display, get there early on sunny weekends
