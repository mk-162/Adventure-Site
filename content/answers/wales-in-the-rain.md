# What to Do in Wales When It Rains?

## Quick Answer

Don't let a bit of rain ruin your Welsh adventure! Wales offers plenty of exciting activities that are either unaffected or even enhanced by wet weather. Consider heading underground for an adventure, embracing the elements with watersports, or enjoying the thrill of indoor or sheltered attractions.

## The Detail

Wales has many options to keep you entertained, even when the weather isn't cooperating:

*   **Embrace the Water:** Since you're likely to get wet anyway, why not try activities like white water rafting in Snowdonia or coasteering in Pembrokeshire? Surfing lessons are also a great option; you're already in the water! Sea kayaking tours can be incredible in the mist, offering a unique perspective on the coastline.
*   **Go Underground:** Explore the depths of the Welsh landscape at Bounce Below, an underground trampoline park in a slate mine in Snowdonia. Alternatively, try a guided underground adventure in a real mine for a fascinating and sheltered experience.
*   **Adrenaline Rush (Mostly Covered):** Zip World's Velocity 2 zip line is exhilarating regardless of the weather. The Zip World Fforest Coaster is a toboggan run on rails, that runs through the trees, offering some shelter, and plenty of thrills.
*   **Mountain Biking (Dress Appropriately):** While a sunny ride is ideal, many mountain biking trails, like the MinorTaur and Temtiwr trails in Snowdonia, are still great fun in the rain. Downhill mountain biking at Antur Stiniog is another option, just be prepared for mud!
*   **Climbing (Indoor Options):** Both Snowdonia and Pembrokeshire offer rock climbing taster sessions and full days. Some providers have access to indoor climbing walls if the outdoor rock is too wet.

**Activities to Avoid (or Re-evaluate):**

*   **Hiking Exposed Peaks:** While experienced hikers may still tackle Snowdon or Crib Goch in the rain, visibility can be severely limited, and conditions can become treacherous. Consider lower-level walks or postpone if possible.
*   **Exposed Rock Climbing:** Rock climbing on exposed faces becomes significantly more difficult and dangerous when wet. Opt for indoor options or reschedule.

## The Smart Choice

Personally, I'd head to Snowdonia and opt for the Underground Adventure. It's a unique and fascinating way to experience Welsh history and geology, and you're guaranteed to stay dry! If you're after adrenaline, Velocity 2 is hard to beat in any weather. If you want to embrace the elements, coasteering in Pembrokeshire is an unforgettable experience.
