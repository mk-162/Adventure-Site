# Trans Cambrian Way

## 175km Across the Heart of Wales

The Trans Cambrian Way is mountain biking at its most elemental: three days crossing the oldest mountain range in Europe, through some of the most remote and beautiful terrain in Britain. No trail centres, no uplift trucks, no café stops every few miles. Just you, your bike, and the vast, empty Cambrian Mountains.

This isn't a ride for Instagram likes. It's a proper adventure — the kind where you'll finish with stories, not just photos. Where the climbing breaks you down and the descents put you back together. Where you'll sleep deeply, eat everything, and understand why people fall in love with wild places.

The route runs 175km from Knighton on the English border to Machynlleth on the edge of Snowdonia, climbing approximately 4,000 metres over three days. It follows ancient drovers' roads, Roman paths, and tracks that have been used for millennia. The landscape is rolling moorland, dark forests, and valleys that feel untouched by time.

If you want manicured singletrack and graded trails, look elsewhere. If you want an experience that'll stay with you, read on.

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1: Knighton to Rhayader

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 54 km |
| **Climbing** | ~1,200m |
| **Terrain** | Grassy climbs, moorland, forest |
| **Highlights** | Beacon Hill, Abbeycwmhir Forest |

You start in Knighton, a border town sitting astride Offa's Dyke — the ancient earthwork marking the boundary between Wales and England. The irony of starting a Welsh adventure in a town that's half English isn't lost on anyone.

The morning offers a gentle warm-up through Knucklas before the first real climb onto Beacon Hill. This is where the Cambrian Mountains announce themselves: open moorland, big skies, and visibility that stretches for miles on clear days. You'll be grateful for the views because the grass can be energy-sapping.

From Beacon Hill, you stay high along Stankey Hill before dropping to Llanbadarn Fynydd for lunch. The afternoon brings the long climb to Bwlch Sarnau — the kind of sustained effort that makes you question your life choices. The reward is the descent over Abbeycwmhir Forest and into Rhayader for your first night.

**Accommodation:** Rhayader has several B&Bs and a good pub scene. Book ahead in peak season.

**Local tip:** The grass on Beacon Hill gets boggy after rain. If it's been wet, expect to push sections. No shame in that.

### Day 2: Rhayader to Llangurig

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 74 km |
| **Climbing** | ~1,600m |
| **Terrain** | Reservoirs, high passes, remote valleys |
| **Highlights** | Elan Valley, Claerwen Dam, Teifi Pools |

This is the big day. 74km and 1,600m of climbing through the wildest terrain on the route. Start early, eat breakfast like you mean it, and pack more food than you think you'll need.

You'll head west into the Elan Valley — a string of Victorian reservoirs that supplied Birmingham with water. The scenery is spectacular: dark water, dramatic dams, and wooded hillsides that feel almost Scottish. A series of bridleways lead to the sunken road and on to Claerwen Dam, the most remote of the reservoirs.

From Claerwen, you ride around the reservoir and onto the Teifi Pools — the source of the River Teifi, sitting in bleak moorland that feels like the end of the world. This is peak Trans Cambrian: no phone signal, no other people, just you and the elements.

The route then heads east toward Cwmystwyth before two long climbs through Tarenig Forest. These are brutal — not technically difficult, just relentlessly steep when you're already 50km into your day. The descents offer some relief, but you'll earn every metre.

Finish in Llangurig, a small village that feels like paradise after the day you've had.

**Accommodation:** Limited options in Llangurig — The Black Lion is traditional. Some riders carry on to stay at The Lodge in Staylittle (adds distance but better facilities).

**Local tip:** Don't underestimate Day 2. It's the crux of the route. If you're struggling at Claerwen, you've got a long way to go. Be honest with yourself about pace and energy.

**E-bike note:** Battery management is critical. Day 2 is 74km and 1,600m climbing. Older full-power bikes with 504Wh batteries won't make it. You need 625Wh minimum, or a lighter SL-style motor. Call ahead if uncertain.

### Day 3: Llangurig to Machynlleth

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 47 km |
| **Climbing** | ~1,200m |
| **Terrain** | Forest, moorland, singletrack finish |
| **Highlights** | Hafren Forest, Glyndŵr's Way, Mach trails |

The final day is shorter but not easy. You've got tired legs, and the terrain doesn't care.

Start by climbing toward Hafren Forest — source of the River Severn — for a more relaxed morning than the previous days. The trails through Hafren are technical in places, offering some of the best riding of the route if your legs have anything left.

From Hafren, follow Glyndŵr's Way toward Staylittle and onto Foel Fadian. The climb to Foel Fadian is the last significant effort — a steady grind that opens up to stunning views across the Dyfi Valley and toward Cadair Idris.

The descent into Machynlleth is pure reward: over 200m of elevation lost down the valley, leading onto the Mach 2/3 trail network. These are proper built trails — a taste of trail-centre riding after three days of natural terrain. The final kilometres into Machynlleth are a victory lap.

Load bikes, celebrate, reflect on what you've done.

**Finish:** Machynlleth has good food, pubs, and transport links. The Dyfi Bike Park is nearby if you're not completely destroyed.

**Local tip:** The enduro trails above Mach are excellent if you've got any energy left. Most people don't.

## Practical Information

### When to Ride

**Best:** May-June, September. Warm enough to be comfortable, ground drier, daylight hours good.

**Good:** April, July-August, October. April can be wet; summer can be busy in the valleys; October brings shorter days and potential weather.

**Avoid:** November-March unless you're experienced in winter conditions. The high ground is exposed and serious.

### What Bike?

**Ideal:** Hardtail or short-travel full-suspension (100-120mm). Something you can pedal all day but that handles rough terrain.

**Fine:** Gravel bike if you're experienced, but expect to walk some sections.

**Not ideal:** Long-travel enduro bike (too heavy for the climbing), rigid bike (your wrists will hate you).

### What to Carry

Day riding setup plus:
- Waterproof jacket (always, whatever the forecast)
- Enough food for long days
- Phone with offline maps (no signal in many areas)
- Basic tools and spare tube
- First aid essentials
- Emergency bivvy bag (optional but smart)

### Navigation

The route is not waymarked. You need:
- GPX file loaded on device or phone
- OS maps as backup
- Competence in navigation

**GPX available from:** Cycling UK, Komoot, various online sources. Cross-reference multiple sources — routes vary slightly.

### Guided Options

If you'd rather not navigate yourself, [Mountain Bike Wales](/operators/mountain-bike-wales) run guided Trans Cambrian trips including accommodation, food, and kit transfers. They literally live on the route and know it intimately.

## Fitness & Ability

### Fitness Required

You should be comfortable with:
- 5+ hour days in the saddle
- 1,000m+ climbing per day
- Consecutive days of hard riding

If you're not sure, train with some long days in the hills before attempting the TCW.

### Technical Ability Required

Moderate. The terrain is rough but not technical in the trail-centre sense. You need to handle:
- Loose, rocky descents
- Grass and mud (potentially lots of mud)
- Some pushing/carrying on steep or boggy sections

If you can ride a red-grade trail centre confidently, you'll manage the TCW technically.

## Why Ride It?

There are easier ways to spend three days. Smoother trails, better weather, less suffering.

But the Trans Cambrian offers something different: a journey through a landscape that feels genuinely wild, on tracks that have been used for thousands of years, through communities that still feel connected to the land. You'll finish with a deeper understanding of Wales — not just its trails, but its soul.

The word *hiraeth* is Welsh, untranslatable, meaning something like homesickness for a place you've never been, or can never return to. Riders who complete the Trans Cambrian often describe feeling hiraeth afterward — a longing to be back in those empty mountains, even while being grateful to be warm and fed again.

That's what this route offers. Not just a ride, but a connection.
