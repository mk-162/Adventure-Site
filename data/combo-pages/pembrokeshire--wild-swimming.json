  "introduction": "Pembrokeshire Coast National Park isn't just about clifftop walks; it's a wild swimming paradise. The rugged coastline, dotted with secluded coves and boasting unbelievably clear water (on a good day!), makes it ideal for both seasoned wild swimmers and adventurous beginners. What sets Pembrokeshire apart is the sheer variety: you can hurl yourself into the exhilarating depths of the Blue Lagoon, paddle gently in the sheltered waters of Barafundle Bay, or explore hidden sea caves at low tide. \n\nHowever, it's not all sunshine and lollipops. Pembrokeshire waters can be surprisingly cold, even in summer, and the Atlantic swells can turn a millpond into a washing machine in a heartbeat. Respecting the sea is paramount. If you're new to wild swimming, stick to sheltered spots and consider a guided tour – TYF Adventure and Preseli Venture are excellent. \n\n**Wild swimming Pembrokeshire** is best suited to those who enjoy a bit of adventure. You might have to scramble down rocks, navigate slippery seaweed, and keep an eye on the tides. It's perfect for independent spirits who appreciate the raw beauty of the Welsh coastline and the invigorating feeling of immersing themselves in nature. Be warned – the post-swim pasty from The Shed is dangerously addictive. Finding parking near some of the more popular spots can be a nightmare in the summer, so arrive early or be prepared to walk. And don’t even think about swimming after a heavy rainfall, the water quality plummets.\n\nEmbrace the wild, respect the sea, and prepare for an unforgettable **wild swimming pembrokeshire** experience. You might even spot a grey seal! Don't forget that final piece of **wild swimming Pembrokeshire** advice - always check the tides!",
