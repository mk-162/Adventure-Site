# What to Wear Coasteering

Coasteering in Wales is an unforgettable experience, scrambling and swimming along rugged coastlines. Here's what you *actually* need, focusing on practicality and the specific conditions you'll face here.

## The Essentials

*   **Wetsuit (Full Length, 5mm recommended):** Absolutely critical. The Welsh waters are cold, even in summer. A full-length wetsuit provides essential insulation to prevent hypothermia, allowing you to enjoy the experience safely for a longer period. 5mm is the sweet spot – warm enough without being too restrictive for swimming.
*   **Buoyancy Aid (BA):** A non-negotiable safety item. Coasteering involves swimming, and a BA keeps you afloat, conserving energy and preventing panic, especially in choppy conditions or if you're a less confident swimmer. Reputable coasteering operators will always provide these, but if you are going alone, do not skip this vital piece of equipment.
*   **Helmet:** Protection from rocks is crucial. Welsh coastlines are rocky and unforgiving. A helmet safeguards your head from bumps and scrapes during scrambles and potential impacts while swimming near rocks.
*   **Sturdy Footwear (Old Trainers or Coasteering Shoes):** Protects your feet and provides grip. Sharp barnacles, slippery seaweed, and uneven terrain are common. Old trainers with good grip are ideal. Coasteering-specific shoes are even better, offering enhanced grip and ankle support. No flip-flops or bare feet!
*   **Swimsuit or Quick-Drying Underwear:** To wear beneath the wetsuit. Avoid cotton as it holds water and stays cold.
*   **Towel and Warm Clothes for Afterwards:** You'll be wet and likely a bit cold after your coasteering adventure. Warm, dry clothes are essential for recovery.

## Nice to Have

*   **Wetsuit Gloves (3mm):** While not essential, gloves significantly improve comfort in colder waters. They protect your hands from the cold and sharp rocks.
*   **Wetsuit Boots/Socks (3-5mm):** Similar to gloves, boots/socks enhance warmth and prevent blisters from footwear rubbing. Especially good if your chosen footwear isn't designed for water sports.
*   **Rash Vest:** Provides a thin layer of insulation and reduces chafing under the wetsuit. Particularly useful if you have sensitive skin.
*   **Waterproof Camera (GoPro or Similar):** Captures the incredible scenery and adrenaline-fueled moments. Ensure it's securely attached to you.
*   **Dry Bag (Small):** For storing essential items like keys or a phone, but be mindful that you'll be swimming.
*   **Sunscreen:** Even on overcast days, UV rays can penetrate. Protect exposed skin, especially your face.

## Don't Bother With

*   **Expensive Jewelry:** Leave it at home. It's likely to get lost or damaged.
*   **Cotton Clothing (Under Wetsuit):** As mentioned, cotton retains water and makes you colder.
*   **Bulky Backpacks:** They'll get in the way and make swimming difficult and potentially dangerous.
*   **Anything You're Worried About Losing/Damaging:** Coasteering is a rugged activity.

## Hire vs Buy

*   **Wetsuit, Buoyancy Aid, Helmet:** Hiring these locally is generally the best option, especially for beginners. Reputable coasteering operators provide well-maintained, appropriate-sized gear. You also avoid the cost of purchasing potentially bulky items you might only use occasionally.
*   **Footwear:** If you plan on coasteering regularly, investing in a pair of dedicated coasteering shoes is worthwhile. Otherwise, using old trainers is perfectly adequate.
*   **Gloves/Boots/Socks:** These are relatively inexpensive and can be worth buying if you coasteer often and are sensitive to the cold.
*   **Camera:** If you want good quality footage, buy or hire something like a GoPro. If you are looking for an underwater disposable camera, you are more likely to be disappointed.

## Where to Go Coasteering in Wales

*   **Pembrokeshire** is the coasteering capital of Wales. The Blue Lagoon at Abereiddy, the cliffs around St Davids, and the bays near Solva offer world-class coasteering with crystal-clear water and dramatic rock formations.

*   **Anglesey** has a completely different character — sea caves, narrow gullies, and interesting geology. Less crowded than Pembrokeshire in peak season. [Find coasteering in Anglesey](/anglesey/things-to-do/coasteering).
*   **The Gower Peninsula** is closer to South Wales cities and has beautiful coastline around Mumbles and the south coast. [Find coasteering on the Gower](/gower/things-to-do/coasteering).
*   **The Llŷn Peninsula** offers more remote, uncrowded coasteering in stunning settings. [Find coasteering on the Llŷn Peninsula](/llyn-peninsula/things-to-do/coasteering).

## Wales-Specific Tips

*   **Weather is unpredictable:** Welsh weather can swing from sunshine to squall in minutes. Check the forecast, but pack as if it'll rain regardless.
*   **Tidal range is huge:** Welsh coastlines have some of the largest tidal ranges in the world. This dramatically alters routes — sections accessible at low tide become impassable (or dangerous) at high tide. Go with a professional guide unless you have real local knowledge.
*   **Rocky coastlines:** Pembrokeshire's rock is volcanic and grippy, which is a plus. Anglesey has smoother, more slippery formations. Footwear matters either way.
*   **Water temperature:** The Irish Sea rarely exceeds 15°C even in August. At Abereiddy's Blue Lagoon, it's often colder — genuinely freezing is how most people describe it. A good 5mm wetsuit is essential, not just recommended.
*   **Sea conditions:** The Irish Sea can turn rough quickly. Swell, wind chop, and tidal currents all affect safety. Experienced guides check conditions constantly and will reroute or cancel if needed.
