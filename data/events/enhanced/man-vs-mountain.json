  "description": "Man vs Mountain is the ultimate showdown between runner and Wales' highest peak. Starting in Llanberis, the route climbs to the summit of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) at 1,085m before descending back to the finish. With a mix of technical mountain paths, loose rock, and stunning ridgeline running, this is pure mountain racing at its finest. The views from the summit on a clear day stretch to Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Lake District. But this race isn't about the scenery—it's about conquering the mountain. Whether you race the clock or race yourself, crossing that finish line after summiting Snowdon is an achievement to treasure.",
