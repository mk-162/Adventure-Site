### 6.3 Important Caveats

⚠️ **Snowdonia Closure:**
- Indefinite closure due to Chief Instructor requirement
- Monitor for reopening announcements
- Still worth featuring as "coming soon" - it's the most scenic
- Don't over-promise availability

⚠️ **Weather Dependency:**
- ALL skydiving is weather-dependent
- Customers need flexibility
- Spring/autumn may have more cancellations than summer
- Set expectations: "Allow buffer days if traveling far"

⚠️ **Weight Limits:**
- Haverfordwest stricter (15st men, 13st women) vs 18st elsewhere
- MUST disclose this clearly to avoid disappointment
- Surcharges at Swansea for 15-18 stone range

⚠️ **Seasonality:**
- March-November only (winter closure)
- Peak season books up fast (June-August)
- Quieter shoulder seasons better for nervous first-timers

## 11. Conclusion

✅ **Research Complete!**

Wales has a small but high-quality skydiving offering with spectacular scenery that rivals anywhere in the UK. While there are only 3 dropzones (vs 40+ in England), the quality of views - from Gower's golden beaches to Pembrokeshire's dramatic cliffs to Snowdonia's mountain panoramas - makes Wales a standout destination.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Swansea (GoSkydive)** is the premium option - highest jumps, professional operation, Gower views
2. **Haverfordwest** is the budget-friendly choice - great Pembrokeshire scenery, £250 price point
3. **Snowdonia** (when it reopens) is the most scenic - jumping ABOVE Mount Snowdon is truly unique

**Biggest Opportunity:** Position Wales as THE place for scenic skydiving in the UK. The "Jump Above Snowdon" angle is unbeatable when operational.
